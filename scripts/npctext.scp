My boss has given me a pretty strict deadline, but my boys and I couldn't come up with anything.$b$bNothing was working, so we decided to "borrow" one of their prototypes. I sent Wizzlecrank to the Sludge Fen to steal one, but he hasn't gotten back yet!

text0_0=Naralex sleeps again!$b$bLong ago, Naralex journeyed to this cavern with the honorable goal of entering the Emerald Dream and regrowing the Barrens into a lush forest. His focus waned and his thoughts became tainted by serpentine visions.$b$bNow, reptilian beasts seep from his dreams to the land. He must be awoken from the nightmare or he will be forever lost, and a great evil unleashed.$b$bOnly after his corrupted servants, the Fanglords, have been slain can I perform the awakening ritual.

text0_0=If you ask me, I think the goblins are a shoe in.  We have the tools, and we have the talent!
text1_0=If it weren't for that cursed, gnomish luck, they'd never win a race!
text2_0=If I were you, I'd buy a goblin race voucher.  Rooting for the other team is a waste of time.
text3_0=My money's on the goblins!  And if you have any sense then yours is too!
text4_0=I heard they were going to try to blow up the gnome's car in the next race!  True or not, I'd stand clear of their pit area.

[npctext 779]

text0_0=Oh, you mean Johnson?  I heard he's in hiding.
text1_0=Hah!  Tirth's been looking for him for days, but he doesn't want to be found.  He's chicken!
text2_0=You looking for plucky?  Well, you didn't hear me say this, but... maybe if you ask Kronkrider up in the tower, he'll tell you...

[npctext 780]
text0_0=If it weren't for the goblins' inconceivable, dumb luck, they'd crash their car during every race!
text1_0=These races are a great opportunity to show our ingenuity!
text2_0=I installed a new device in our car's matrix regulometer.  That should increase its velocity quotient by a factor of no less than fifteen!
text3_0=My son could design a faster car than that clunky goblin junk heap!

text1_0=Johnson?  I think he's around here somewhere...
text2_0=Plucky?  I heard race master Kronkrider up on the the tower knows where he is.

[npctext 798]
text0_0=At last! I am finally free from this cell!$b$bThe Kirin Tor sent me from Dalaran to investigate Arugal's progress with the undead here in Silverpine Forest. Little did we know that the wizard had lost his grasp on sanity.$b$bI must report this mess at once! But before I leave, allow me to undo the magical lock on the courtyard door.$b$bYou defeated Rethilgore, perhaps you will survive what lies beyond....

[npctext 799]
text0_0=At last! Someone to free me from this cell!$b$bHigh Executor Hadrec sent us to gather information on the Keep so that a plan could be formulated to overthrow Arugal once and for all.$b$bBut the old wizard has many tricks up his sleeve and we were detected by a magical ward. I was thrown in this prison. Vincent was not so lucky.$b$bI must return to Hadrec to debrief him at once. But first I will pick the lock to the courtyard door for you. Perhaps you can try your luck against the foes that lurk beyond.

[npctext 818]
text0_0=I once followed the ways of the Twilight's Hammer. Obsessed with reviving the Old Gods, I journeyed deep into this lair to try to draw power from the cursed beast, Aku'mai!$b$bAfter witnessing the sacrifice of countless innocents, I came to my senses.$b$bI was trapped but now I am free! But so far from my homeland of Khaz Modan!$b$bBrave adventurer, I offer you passage to a very special land in return for slaying Aku'mai. If you wish, I can port you to the city of Darnassus.

text2_0=Check around Old Town at the Barracks or the Pig and Whistle Tavern. If you go to the tavern, be sure to sample some of the fine brews. Puts the dwarven ales to shame, I tell ya.

[npctext 943]
text0_0=Yes, I have seen the shaman you seek. Last I saw her, she was to the west of here. She hides in the hills above the Razormane tribe.

text0_0=Salutations.  My function is to offer access to and, when permissible, insight into information regarding the Creators' synthesis of the Earthen on the world designated as Azeroth.  I am ready to share this information with you now at your leisure.

[npctext 1080]
text0_0=The Earthen are a synthesized race engineered by the Creators, functioning as one of the seed races in the initial population of the world designated as Azeroth.  The Earthen were created to aid the Creators' efforts in shaping the deep regions of this world.$B$BThey are a modification of the standard subterranean being matrix used on other worlds that the Creators have seeded.  The construction of this prototype race created various anomalies that were observed after initial synthesis.

[npctext 1081]
text0_0=It is one of the synthesis matrices the Creators use when seeding a world.  Each synthesis matrix is used to achieve the Creators' goals.  For Azeroth, a subterranean being matrix was modified to create a being with increased durability with an affinity for deep region shaping; the Earthen are the product of this modification.$B$BAfter the Earthen had been put into service for the Creators, unforeseen anomalies were discovered that affected their synthesis matrix due to high-stress environments.

[npctext 1082]
text0_0=Additional background information on the Earthen must be given to you before this question may be answered properly.$B$BProcessing.$B$BTo understand the anomalies of the Earthen, it is first important to understand what the Earthen represent in their design intent.  The Earthen represent the Creators' attempt at improving the survivability paradigm of the standard subterranean being matrix.  This was done by incorporating a resilient foundation of construction inherent to the world into said matrix.

[npctext 1083]
text0_0=It is the baseline material used in race synthesis.  A cross-section of Azeroth's crust was used as the foundation for the Earthen's synthesis rather than the typical biomass construction foundation used by the Creators.$B$BResearch on the world's composition led the Creators to theorize that an enhanced being could be synthesized that would epitomize the resiliency of this world's essence.  This was accomplished by choosing to use a blend of Azeroth's various stone core compounds as the foundation.

[npctext 1084]
text0_0=Simply stated, this is correct.$B$BThe Earthen's physical features are that of a smaller stature humanoid, though their composition is that of Azeroth's various stone core compounds.  Their design maximizes strength and stamina without sacrificing cognitive processing power.  Their skin and musculature are nearly impervious to physical damage, and with very minor modifications the Earthen display a remarkable resiliency to unwanted magical forces.

[npctext 1085]
text0_0=It is integral to the assimilation of this data that it is understood that the Creators wanted to synthesize a race that would long be an integral part of this world's development cycle after they had departed.  This race would be instrumental in fulfilling the Creators' long-term development objectives for Azeroth.  $B$BAs an ancillary note, the nomenclature "Earthen" was deemed apropos for the new race by the Creators, based on the Earthen's composition.

[npctext 1086]
text0_0=The Earthen's only anomaly in synthesis is the tendency for matrix destabilization while being utilized in high-stress environments.$B$BAddendum: deep earth sculpting was naturally suited to the new matrix design and thus never met the qualifications of duplicating a high-stress environment.$B$BDestabilization was not discovered until well into the Earthen's primary service cycle for the Creators.  The Creators began work on post-synthesis modification, rather than recall and re-synthesis.

text0_0=[There is a noticeable pause after you ask this question.]$B$BThe information you request is not currently available in this repository's data cycling.  I sincerely apologize for this omission.$B$BPlease request this information after a data cycling update has been performed on this information repository.  You may also request this information from another information repository located on Azeroth.

[npctext 1088]
text0_0=There are two potential results when the Earthen's synthesis matrix destabilizes.  Initiating visual aid representation number one.$B$BThe first variant matrix is a degenerative product of synthesis, hereby designated with the common nomenclature of "Trogg".  This variant maintains strength and stamina comparable to the Earthen, but its cognitive processing power has been almost completely compromised.  Force of will and a strong sense of cunning are the only driving factors in the psyche of the trogg.

[npctext 1089]
text0_0=I am unable to process your chronological reference in comparison to the recording of this data, my apologies.$B$BThe trogg retains some composition of Azeroth's various stone core compounds, but the loss of cognitive power makes this variant unacceptable to the Creators.$B$BThe trogg procreates as per a standard biomass.  By default it consumes stone and anything else it can acquire, including other troggs.  Cannibalism is considered unacceptable by the Creators.

[npctext 1090]
text0_0=Initiating visual aid representation number two.$B$BThe second resultant variance of the Earthen matrix retains many desired elements when compared to the standard subterranean matrix.  The common nomenclature for this variant is "Dwarf".$B$BThis variant retains strength and stamina inherent to the Earthen.  In some cases, the dwarf even exceeds the cognitive powers of the Earthen's matrix.  The dwarf, however, retains none of the physical composition of Azeroth's various stone core compounds.

[npctext 1091]
text0_0=The data stored in this repository does indeed correlate with your astute proclamation.$B$BThe dwarf maintains an affinity for the stone composition of Azeroth, but due to the high-stress environmental anomaly within the Earthen's synthesis matrix, the dwarf reverts to a default biomass composition as seen in the standard subterranean matrix.$B$BErgo, the dwarf variant does synthesize from the degeneration of the Earthen creation matrix, as you inferred with your query.

[npctext 1092]
text0_0=I am unable to process your chronological reference in comparison to the recording of this data, my apologies.$B$BThough the dwarf maintains most of the Earthen's mental attunement to Azeroth's stone composition, the reversion back into living biomass remains the main degeneration of the matrix.  Dwarves eat and procreate through means typical to other standard biomasses.$B$BThe Creators view the dwarf as an acceptable variant, worthy of genesis in its own right.

[npctext 1093]
text0_0=The Creators are... the Creators.$B$BThey are the beings that seeded and shaped this world by their own design.  They are the reason for this world's existence, as well as many other worlds.  They are the wellspring from which Azeroth flows.

[npctext 1094]
text0_0=The Creators are cognizant of the magnitude of the information housed in this repository.  Subsequently, a portable copy of the data stored here will be made available to you once you are attuned with the Discs of Norgannon.$B$BPlease consider your cursory requirements for the assimilation of this knowledge to be complete.  At your leisure, access the Discs of Norgannon to begin synthesis of your discs.

text0_0=About five months ago, the Venture Co.'s Stranglethorn division got their hands on a special poison from a shady merchant in Booty Bay named Crank Fizzlebub. Fizzlebub had apparently stolen the poison from Zanzil!$B$BYes, Zanzil the Outcast - the troll that was exiled from his own tribe due to the nature of his 'experiments' in necromancy.$B$BNaturally, once they had the poison, they proceeded to test it on each other.

text0_0=The beasts of these blasted lands exhibit preternatural attributes, heretofore unseen in nature.$B$BWe have theorized that the energy which was released upon the opening of the Dark Portal, infused into their physical being and forced the creatures to evolve into their current forms.$B$BFearsome beasts they are, no doubt, but we also believe that they could prove to be quite useful in our studies.$B$BPerhaps you would be interested in assisting us in the study of these beasts, $N?

[npctext 1371]
text0_1=While my brother, Drazial, focuses his analysis on the more physical nature of the beasts of the blasted lands, I tend to focus on the more cerebral and spiritual aspects of the wildlife.$B$BIt is true that the beasts exhibit extremely unusual strength, agility, and stamina, but some of them also possess great intelligence and regenerative abilities, untied to their physical being.$B$BPerhaps you would be interested in helping advance my research, $r?

[npctext 1391]
text0_0=It's hard to imagine that so much death and despair could be confined to such a small area; yet beyond the swamp is a land plagued by chaos and destruction.$B$BWatch your step, adventurer. The Blasted Lands are the final resting place to far greater beings than you.

[npctext 1392]
text0_0=Thrall's Grasp they called us: Twenty of Thrall's most accomplished and honored soldiers.$B$BI had ordered the regiment to build an encampment here, on the border of the Blasted Lands, while we waited for our orders to arrive from Orgrimmar. Weeks passed without word from the warchief; the men grew restless.$B$BIt was a judgment call, $N. I was young and ambitious, afraid of nothing. The battalion would set forth into the Blasted Lands under my command.$B$BA decision I would later regret.

[npctext 1411]
text0_0=Regret. It is all I have now. One bad decision resulting in several horrible outcomes. If only I had waited for those orders. Maybe they would have detailed the horrors that awaited us in those cursed lands! Maybe they were to redirect us to another detail? Ultimately, it was my fault. All of it was my fault.

[npctext 1451]
text0_0=Would you believe that in my darkest hour, at the apex of my being, I failed.$B$BAs I fled from the wanton destruction of the forces that overwhelmed us, the only sounds I could hear were the screams of my soldiers and the rapid beat of my own heart.$B$BA short while later, I returned to the Blasted Lands in hopes of rescuing my men and restoring my honor. Instead I was captured and beaten until dead.$B$BWhat I found out during my inquisition and subsequent torture was horrifying.

[npctext 1452]
text0_0=My captors were cruel beyond measure, $N. They would alternate between Lieutenant Kirith and I, torturing one while the other watched. During a lull in the activity of an especially brutal day, Kirith told me what had happened to my men and a plan he had been formulating to free them from their masters.$B$BThey suffered a fate far worse than death, or even the pain Kirith and I  endured.

[npctext 1453]
text0_0=Neither you nor I could possibly imagine the pain an individual suffers when their soul is ripped from their body. They are not dead and by no means are they alive. Instead, they walk the land, servants of those that bind them to this world.$B$BLord Razelikh, demonic overlord of these lands, enslaved them all. Nine he took for his own, placing stones of binding near the Dark Portal. The remaining nine were divided up between his subordinates.

[npctext 1454]
text0_0=The archmage Allistarj of the Shadowsworn was granted three. Lady Sevine, warlock of the Shadowsworn was also granted three. The remaining three were given to Grol the Destroyer, lord of the Dreadmaul ogres of these blasted lands.$B$BYou see, $N, without a soul, the body cannot be killed. The remnants of my men are now indestructible fighting units. Thankfully, they are bound in how far they can travel by the stones of binding.

[npctext 1455]
text0_0=They are exactly what you need to destroy in order to free the regiment! As I had told you earlier, Kirith had a plan.$B$BEach of the servants does have a weakness. Punish their physical form in proximity of their stones until they are near the state of disintegration. It is at that point, and that point alone, that the stones of binding are vulnerable to attack. You must hurry to destroy the stones, however, as once the enslaved regain their composure, they will be invulnerable to harm once more.

[npctext 1456]
text0_0=I wish it were true, $N, but it will take more than you alone to overcome the forces of Razelikh and his subordinates.$B$BGather a suitable group of adventurers and would-be heroes and free my men of their eternal torture!

I then send the eggs along to Darnassus where they can be nurtured, safe from the Gordunni ogres' dark magics.$B$BPlease know, $N, some of the rescued eggs are bad eggs, and will never hatch.

text0_0=In the age of war, Razelikh the Defiler served as the most fearsome of Lord Kazzak's lieutenants. When the Legion was defeated and Kazzak forced back into the Tainted Scar, Razelikh was tasked by his master to secure the Blasted Lands.$B$BWhile the Alliance fought petty battles with the Horde over territory outside of the Blasted Lands, Razelikh was uniting the differing Shadow Council sects and the brutish Dreadmaul ogres of the land.

[npctext 1814]
text0_0=Tragically, it was Thrall's wisdom that finally sealed the bond between the demon lord and his minions. It was Trebor's regiment that served as the catalyst to unite the demon lord, the shadowsworn sects and the ogres. The lure of nearly unlimited power and the granting of immortal shock troops to each respective leader sealed the deal in blood.

[npctext 1815]
text0_0=What Sevine, Allistarj, and Grol did not realize was that just as their servants were bound to the land, so would they be... You see, the price for their own immortality was also imprisonment and eternal servitude under the command of Razelikh. The cruel cunning of Razelikh had emerged the victor once again.

[npctext 1816]
text0_0=Their minds are now tainted, $r. Yes, even more so than before. They live only to serve and protect Razelikh. The amulet fragments they each hold are the key to summoning the demon lord. What you do not understand is that none of them can be harmed through any conventional means.

[npctext 1817]
text0_0=Then let us pretend that you undergo the long and arduous task of creating the bane necessary to break through the demonic wards placed upon the triad. What would be your next course of action? To face the Defiler in his lair?$B$B<Loramus laughs.>

Weeks ago, it was burned down.$b$bThe Warchief told us to leave the humans alone, so long as they didn't cross our borders, but it appears someone violated his wishes.$b$bHe has put me in charge of getting to the bottom of it. If you wish to provide assistance, go to the remains of the Shady Rest Inn and return any clues you find to me.

[npctext 1833]
text0_1=I don't care to hear it, $N. Nope, no way are you going to be let into the Searing Gorge. Impossible. Not going to happen. How many times do I have to tell you - I can't let you in! Do you not speak common? Are you an orc in disguise? N-O. NO!$B$BIf I let you in, then I have to let everybody in. Pretty soon your close friends will want in, then their distant relatives, then their friends, and so on and so forth. The last time that happened... well, we won't talk about the last time it happened.

[npctext 1834]
text0_1=Are you mad? Do you know what manner of beast inhabit that place? The worst that can happen is that we'll have to scoop up your remains with a shovel. We've lost some good dwarves to those awful monsters.$B$BSo the answer is no. If you're bent on getting to the Searing Gorge, you'll have to find another way.

[npctext 1835]
text0_1=I shouldn't even be telling you this but if you can make it past all the critters and beasties in Badlands, you might be able to make it to Searing Gorge.$B$BYes, the Badlands. There's some type of back road the orcs paved near Kargath. Just goes to show you what kind of fools we're dealing with here! A backdoor to hell? What were they thinking?

[npctext 1836]
text0_1=Invulnerable?

[npctext 1837]
text0_1=You're a fool that should heed my warnings. No one is invulnerable. You would be wise to remember that bit of advice.

[npctext 1838]
text0_1=I'll tell you what. Since you fancy yourself the hero type, if you can make your way through the Badlands to the Searing Gorge and bring me back something to prove your heroics, I'll see what I can do about getting you a key.$B$BIn the southeasternmost corner of Searing Gorge is a lady almost as tough as me, Margol the Rager. Maybe you should investigate.

[npctext 1853]
text0_0=What can you do at an inn?$B$BWell when you stay at an inn, you rest very comfortably.  Because of this, you will become "well rested" much more quickly than you would in the wilderness.

[npctext 1921]
text0_0=As a young night elf in Darkshore, I crossed paths with a group of unsavory individuals known as the Twilight's Hammer. A group of them befriended me and shamefully, I ended up eschewing my faith in Elune and embracing the vitriol of the Twilight's Hammer.$B$BIt was not until a vision came to me from Elune, that I woke up from the malaise that I had fallen into as a follower of the old gods.$B$BIn repentance, I began work on my prayer to Elune.

[npctext 1922]
text0_0=Etched into a tablet of pure gold was the embodiment of my remorse, shame, regret, and sorrow. Unfortunately, the Twilight's Hammer found the tablet and branded me a blasphemer. I was summarily executed, my prayer to Elune incomplete. I am now bound to this world as a spirit, unable to transcend to the Nether; held in this cage as a warning to all that would betray the faith of the Twilight's Hammer.

[npctext 1924]
text0_0=Existing in this area are many creatures considered allies of the night elves. The elves have had access to the power within each of these creatures; it is time that the horde be allowed this same satisfaction. I have devised a way that this power can be captured and used for our benefit.$B$BDo not doubt what I tell you, $N. Help me, and you shall see that I speak truth.

Nay, they want not to admit that this part of the world even exists, let alone send their precious military in to administer justice.$B$BI seek vengeance, $r, plain and simple. Is there a more passionate cause in this world?

[npctext 1955]
text0_0=As you can see, I am but one man with a lumbering oaf of a squire. The might of the Dark Iron dwarves and the beasts held in the grip of Ragnaros would surely overwhelm me alone, but I have the utmost confidence that such a brave and ambitious adventurer such as you would have no problem handling the denizens of the cauldron. Should you choose to assist me, I shall reward you with riches and wealth beyond your wildest dreams.

[npctext 1995]
text0_0=I know who you are, $N.  Fate and forces beyond that have brought you to me for a reason, and it is one I take no pleasure in being a part of.  There are many decisions you will make in the coming times, and I hope you are wise enough to make the correct ones.$B$BBelieve me, $r, when I tell you this - there are correct choices.

[npctext 1996]
text0_0=You are quite inquisitive, though such inquisitiveness belies a general lack of understanding.  I say this because were you to have a definite purpose in being here, the question you ask would seem pointless. $B$BWith that, I bid you good day.
unk0_1=21

[npctext 1997]
text0_0=You know I do, mortal; I am abandoning a fair number of pretenses here, and I recommend you do the same.$B$BYou have come here clearly because you know that what you possess, garnered from your actions within the Sunken Temple of the Atal'al, has brought you to me for a purpose.  This purpose is to put my associate... my brother, to rest.  He is trapped within a nightmare within the Dream itself.  He cannot break free alone.
unk0_1=25

[npctext 1998]
text0_0=The god that the Atal'ai trolls had brought forth is to blame for this.  We destroyed the god's physical manifestation and sunk the temple, but the god was much stronger than even we had anticipated.  Its seed of corruption ran deep, twisting everything in its path.$B$BEranikus was charged to watch over the sunken temple to ensure that neither the simple Atal'ai nor their god would rise again.  He was an unwitting victim of this corruption, and we in underestimating its potency.

[npctext 1999]
text0_0=The fact that you are here is a first step... a correct choice if you will, in aiding Ysera's Dragonflight.$B$BYou may be here for purely the lure of personal gain, or you may be here because you are morally compelled.  Neither reason is important on its own, but both are in fact critical to this end: The agony that Eranikus endures is what rousted me from my Dream, and it is now my charge to see his torment ended.  I now ask you to aid me in this quest.

[npctext 2035]
text0_1=I am not here because of honor, $N. I am here because of one orc's pride.$B$BIf I had not rejected Belgrom's offers, then I'm sure I'd still be in Orgrimmar taking care of real business.$B$BHis desire for women is not unknown to many of the female warriors in Durotar, but that doesn't stop him from being his charming self.$B$BHe's lucky he didn't pursue his desire for me much longer though--he'd be short more than just the digits on his hands.

[npctext 2036]

I would have poked around a little more but one of those crazy big vultures chased me off.

But the bulk of his strength remains, lurking at the far end of the Nether.$B$BYou have defeated his avatar once, $N.  Perhaps if you defeat it again you can further weaken the god so that, one day, we might face his true self.$B$BI have prepared a spell that you may use to again summon an avatar of Hakkar within the Sanctum of the Fallen God.  Do you want to confront it once again?

We worked tirelessly to build a dwarven city mightier than any city or fortress that came before... or would come after.

[npctext 2317]
text0_0=I stood by and watched the corruption of Ragnaros seep through the hearts and minds of the Dark Iron nation. This once honorable race, driven to madness... to evil.$B$BWhen the construction of the Spire was complete, my will to live amongst my people gave way. I passed as a hero of the new nation of Dark Iron. This tomb was placed here - at the entrance to the city I planned and built - in honor of my efforts.

[npctext 2318]
text0_0=My great hammer, Ironfel, was handed down to the new chief architect, Fineous Darkvire: A man of despicable motive and little talent.$B$BThis is where you come in, $N. I want him stopped.

It seems to be preference mostly.$B$BEvery time I've encountered ooze, sludge, or slime they have basically been the same creatures. The differences seem to be based on their environment, which is why we need a pure sample.

[npctext 3397]

[npctext 3398]

[npctext 3400]
lang0=7
text0_0=Ye know more than I do, that's a certainty. Tell ye what though, go talk with me da'. He'll want ye ta prove yerself, but he is a fine teacher indeed. His name's Rotgath, and ye'll find him near the anvils workin steel for ol' Bengus.

[npctext 3401]

text0_0=Well my friend, ye have more skill than I do. Why don't ye go find me old friend Rotgath Stonebeard. He stayed in Ironforge when I left to join Jaina's army. I'm sure he'll be able ta teach ye somethin, or at least know someone who can. If he's still around, I'm sure he'll be at The Great Forge.

[npctext 3403]

text0_0=Of course I can help you with training. I'm just a journeyman myself, but I'm sure there's something I can show you.

[npctext 3404]

text0_0=I don't admit this lightly, but you are a far better smith than I am. If you want to learn more than my meager teachings then I suggest you seek out a Dwarf named Therum Deepforge in Stormwind. You will find him in the Dwarven District.

[npctext 3408]

text0_0=A far better blacksmith than I am, that's for sure. Though I'll deny it if you tell anyone I said that. You should go speak with Therum Deepforge. If anyone can teach you more, it's him.

[npctext 3411]

text0_0=Not bad. Go talk with Snarl, he just moved to Orgrimmar to study under Saru. Look for him in the Warrior district near Saru's smithy. Oh and he'll test you, so you better be as ready as you think you are.

[npctext 3412]
lang0=1
text0_0=Snarl calls me simple because I am too slow. I just want to do the job right, and that takes time.

[npctext 3413]
lang0=1
text0_0=I can show you what you wish to know, but you must be patient. Take your time to work the steel and feel the way it shapes beneath your hammer. When you become one with the steel, then you will understand.

[npctext 3414]
lang0=1
text0_0=You learn quickly, that is not a bad thing. Just be sure to do the job right, as long as it takes to do so. Now, I fear I must send you to Snarl to learn more. Learn what he can teach, but do not listen to his angry words. He gets that way when Saru's daughters laugh at him.

[npctext 3415]

text0_0=I listen and I listen but I don't hear these spirits that Karn speaks of.

[npctext 3416]

[npctext 3420]

[npctext 3422]

[npctext 3423]

text0_0=You have learned much, more than I can teach. Go to James Van Brunt, he will teach you what I cannot.

[npctext 3424]
text0_1=E'ko is da unfocused form of the supernatural power, and Juju is da concentrated essence. By using a stong incantation, I can transform da E'ko into Juju.  Once it becomes Juju, you can den use the Cache of Mau'ari ta reflect da powers onto yourself.

text0_0=I said ye had the blood of a blacksmith in ye, and I was right. Go to Ironforge, to The Great Forge, and find yerself a Dwarven smith by the name of Bengus Deepforge. My teacher, and one of the greatest smiths I've ever known.

[npctext 3456]
lang0=7
text0_0=The life of a smith is not an easy one, but it puts steel in yer bones and fire in yer heart. My da' was a smith, my grandfather before him in the forges beneath Grim Batol. And now my son follows in our footsteps, that boy makes me proud.

[npctext 3457]

text0_0=Sorry $g lad : lass;, ye aren't quite up to the challenge of learning from me. Go see my son Groum, it would make his day to get a new apprentice.

[npctext 3458]

[npctext 3460]

text0_0=A fast learner is what ye are, and a good smith to boot. I would sign off on yer work any day of the week. But I sense ye still have some learnin in ye. Go talk to Bengus Deepforge, he's a hard taskmaster but he's also one of the best.

[npctext 3462]

text0_1=Hmm, your work is allright but it's nowhere near the quality I look for in a student. Go talk with Smith Argus in Goldshire, I'm sure he can teach you some basics. Then when you're done, come on back to me and I'll give you a little test to make sure you are ready.

[npctext 3463]
lang0=7
text0_1=Yeah, I've heard through the grapevine that I might be seeing you sooner or later. But I don't just take on anyone, I need to make sure you have what it takes first. You willing to take my little test and find out?

[npctext 3465]
lang0=7
text0_1=Now I'm the one who feels rough around the edges, I honestly don't think there's anything left I can teach you. But you know who can? Bengus Deepforge in Ironforge, now there's a dwarf that knows his steel. Go look him up in The Great Forge of Ironforge, see if he's up to having a new trainee under him.

[npctext 3468]

text0_0=So you think you are good enough to learn from me? The great Snarl? You are no more than a lowly worm beneath my boot. However, taking on an underling might make me seem more appealing to Sumi and Tumi. Let's see what meager skills you possess.

[npctext 3470]

[npctext 3472]

[npctext 3475]
lang0=1
text0_0=Our paths through life intersect only briefly and now is the time for ours to part ways. I consider myself blessed to have spent this time teaching you and now send you along to join paths with your next mentor. Seek out Saru Steelfury of Orgrimmar, he will teach what you need to learn.

[npctext 3476]
lang0=1
text0_0=You have great potential, but you must achieve understanding first, you must accept the spirits and listen to their calling. Only then will you be prepared for the path you must follow. Go speak with Thrag, I think perhaps you can learn a lot from one another.

[npctext 3478]
lang0=1
text0_0=You have learned much, but I sense that there is more left for the spirits to teach you. I can place your foot on the path but cannot guide your steps. Go and find Saru Steelfury in Orgrimmar, the next stretch of your journey begins there.

text0_0=I'm sorry $g lad : lass; but ye just don't have the foundation to learn what I have to teach. But don't fret, go speak with my student Rotgath, he'll help ye out.

[npctext 3484]

text0_0=I can't say enough about yer work, truly amazing things that ye can do with a hammer and an anvil. Now, don't be tellin anyone that I suggested ye go find a goblin to teach ye but that's exactly what I'm gonna do. Brikk Keencraft is his name, and last I heard he was operating a shop down in Booty bay.

[npctext 3485]

text0_0=This isn't a game you toy with youngling! Go, speak with Snarl outside. He may be a serpent in my lair but he does know his way around an anvil.

[npctext 3487]

text0_0=I see you know more of the secret of steel than I do. That is good, for it is meant to be taken. Now you must travel to the jungle south of the human lands, to the goblin city of Booty Bay. There you will find a Goblin named Brikk Keencraft. I do not like Goblins but his knowledge of the secret of steel is unmatched by any I know of.

[npctext 3488]
text0_0=Yeah? Of course I'm a smith. What, you think Dwarves are the only ones worth their weight in anvils? Fine, be that way. Go get a dwarf to help you!

[npctext 3489]
text0_0=Are you kidding me? You must be kidding me! Either that or you think I'm a clown here to amuse you. Is that what you think? That I'm a clown? Huh, is it! You think I'm a clown don't you!

[npctext 3490]
text0_0=You act like this is the best junk I've ever seen. Sure it's ok, but I see stuff this 'OK' every day. Tell you what, you find a way to wow me, and I'll teach you things that make dwarves smile in their sleep.

text0_0=Well there's a gryphon master up in Stormwind if you need to fly somewhere.  You should be able to see the gryphons landing on your right as you walk through the Valley of Heroes.
text1_0=The gryphon master oversees the gryphon flights from within Stormwind.  If you're looking to take a ride, then that's where you should be headed.

[npctext 4262]
text0_0=I believe Aldwin Laughlin is still the resident Guild Master of Stormwind.  Look for his residence on your left as you pass the inner gate of Stormwind.
text1_0=All that official business is handled up in Stormwind these days.  You could stop by the Stormwind Visitor's Center if you want to start a guild.

[npctext 4263]
text0_0=Look no further than the Lion's Pride Inn in Goldshire.  With a wide selection of ales and soft down beds you, couldn't ask for a better place to rest.
text1_0=The Lion's Pride Inn in Goldshire is as good as any inn you will find around these parts.  Drop in and let Innkeeper Farley make you feel at home.

[npctext 4264]
text0_0=There are quite a few trainers available in Elwynn.  Which one are you looking for?

[npctext 4265]
text0_0=Druids?  I haven't seen any druids around here.  Although there is a district in Stormwind that the night elves have made their own.

[npctext 4266]
text0_0=I've heard that there's a dwarf in Stormwind who has achieved some fame for his hunting skill.  Maybe you should go see if he could help you.

[npctext 4267]
text0_0=Josetta has been a blessing to this town with her aid of the local guards.  If you seek her for training in the ways of a priest, you can find her in the Lion's Pride Inn.
text1_0=I bet Josetta would be more than happy to teach you some new spells.  She is probably up in her room at the Lion's Pride Inn.

[npctext 4268]
text0_0=Zaldimar could probably teach you some new spells.  He has recently taken a liking to staying at the Lion's Pride Inn, you might want to check one of the rooms and see if he's in.
text1_0=I don't know much about magic, but there's a mage named Zaldimar who is staying at the Lion's Pride Inn that could probably assist you.

[npctext 4269]
text0_0=You can usually find Brother Wilhelm in back of the smithy trading stories with Lyria.  He's always up for teaching fellow paladins new skills.
text1_0=Brother Wilhelm often trains with Lyria Du Lac out in back of the smithy in Goldshire.  You could probably learn a thing or two about being a paladin from him.

[npctext 4270]
text0_0=A rogue?  Hmmm... well, I've heard that Keryn Sylvius hangs around those shady types.  You might want to talk to her and see what you can learn.
text1_0=I'd wager Keryn Sulvius knows the type you're looking for.  The company Keryn Sylvius keeps is less than   She usually hangs out in the Lion's Pride Inn.

[npctext 4271]
text0_0=Few around here are as skilled with a blade as Lyria Du Lac.  Check for her out behind the smithy and see if she's in the mood to teach you something new.
text1_0=Lyria's the one you should talk to if you need some training.  She can usually be found out behind the smithy waiting for some armor or weapon to be finished.

[npctext 4272]
text0_0=Oh... one of those types.  Well, Maximillian is the only one around here that knows about the dark arts.  You can probably find him in the dark of the Lion's Pride Inn basement.
text1_0=A warlock?  Well, if I was a warlock, I would probably be in the darkest place around here... which would be the Lion's Pride Inn basement.  That's where you should look first.

[npctext 4273]
text0_0=I know of a few people around here that practice a profession or two.  What profession do you have in mind?

[npctext 4274]
text0_0=That hermit Mallory is known to concoct some potions for the local townsfolk on occasion.  He has a cottage in the hills between Stormwind and Northshire.
text1_0=There is an alchemist that lives up in the hills between Northshire and Stormwind that might be of some help.  Why don't you go pay him a visit?

[npctext 4275]
text0_0=Argus is the resident blacksmith of Goldshire.  I'm sure he could teach you the Blacksmith's profession.
text1_0=You must be looking for Smith Argus.  He's usually overseeing the forge in Goldshire if you need some training.

[npctext 4277]
text0_0=Nope, don't think there are any Enchanters here in Elwynn Forest.  There's a guy named Lucan who runs a shop up in Stormwind though.  You could check with him and see if he will train you.
text1_0=Hmmm... only enchanters I know of around here work out of Stormwind.  Why don't you ask one of the guards up in Stormwind?

[npctext 4278]
text0_0=I usually leave that sort of thing to the gnomes.  If you want to take up the profession, I'm sure you could find some gnomes hanging out in Stormwind that would train you.
text1_0=There is bound to be a gnome in Stormwind that can teach you the profession.  I'm sure one of the Stormwind Guards could point you in the right direction.

[npctext 4279]
text0_0=I had a bad encounter with some of the Defias around here recently, but Michelle Belle fixed me up pretty well.  Check with her in the Lion's Pride Inn and see if she'll teach you.
text1_0=Michelle Belle's bedside manner is remarkable!  While she might not be able to teach you that, she surely could teach you some proper First Aid.  She currently resides in the Lion's Pride Inn.

[npctext 4280]
text0_0=Lee Brown spends the whole day fishing up by Crystal Lake.  He's probably got some stories to tell and some tips he could teach you.
text1_0=Lee's caught some pretty odd things up at Crystal Lake.  He told me a story about this weird mask he fished up some months ago.  If you ask me, I think he just had one too many at the Lion's Pride that night.

[npctext 4281]
text0_0=Ms. Pomeroy gathers herbs for an Alchemist who lives up in the hills between Northshire and Stormwind.  Check for her at his cottage and see if she'll show you the profession.
text1_0=There's an herbalist that lives in the hills east of Stormwind with our alchemist. Quite the handy pairing don't you think?

[npctext 4282]
text0_0=Over by Crystal Lake there lives a lady named Adele Fielder.  She makes patches for the local guards with the extra leather she gets from the local skinner, Helene.  She would probably be the one to see if you're interested in learning the profession.
text1_0=Adele Fielder has made a name for herself as a leatherworker around Elwynn.  You can find her working out of her home up by Crystal Lake.

[npctext 4283]
text0_0=You best head up to Stormwind in the Dwarven District if you want to learn to mine.  Surely one of the dwarves there can teach you the profession.
text1_0=I think you'll have better luck looking in Stormwind.  Ask a guard up there and they'll point you in the right direction.

[npctext 4284]
text0_0=Helene Peltskinner has had years of experience skinning animals for Adele Fielder to make leather items.  You can find Helene in her house by Crystal Lake.

[npctext 4288]
text0_0=The nearest bank ye'll find is The Vault in Ironforge, $glad : lass;.
text1_0=The Vault in Ironforge is the closest bank ye'll find in these parts.

[npctext 4289]
text0_0=Ye won't find a gryphon master just anywhere around Dun Morogh, $glad : lass;.  Ye're going to have to go to Ironforge if ye want to take a gryphon somewhere.
text1_0=The closest gryphon master is located up in Ironforge near The Great Forge itself.  Ye'll need to head to Ironforge if ye want to travel by gryphon.

[npctext 4290]
text0_0=All those official types reside in Ironforge.  Ye'll be wanting to check out the Ironforge Visitor's Center for guild creation papers.
text1_0=If ye need to get yer hands on some guild creation papers ye'll have to head up to Ironforge and visit the Ironforge Visitor's Center.

[npctext 4291]
text0_0=The Thunderbrews run a fine Inn in Kharanos which bears their name.  Stop in for a pint and a bit of rest.
text1_0=Oooh, an Inn is it?  Well, ye just can't beat the Thunderbrew Distillery.  Rest if ye must, but be sure to have an ale or two while ye're there.

[npctext 4292]
text0_0=Which class trainer might ye be looking for?

[npctext 4293]
dens0=60.000000
dens1=40.000000
text0_0=There's only one hunter around here I would have ye talk to, and that would be Grif Wildheart.  Ye'll find him standing just outside the smithy in Kharanos.
text1_0=If ye ask me, I think Grif spends a little too much time with the animals.  Still, nobody else knows the hunter's path quite like he does.  Look for him outside the smithy in Kharanos.

[npctext 4294]
dens0=60.000000
dens1=40.000000
text0_0=There's a mage at the Thunderbrew Distillery who might be able to teach you some new spells.  I believe his name is Magis Sparkmantle.
text1_0=Ye sure ye don't want to learn to be a warrior?  Well, it's yer hide on the battlefield.  If ye really want to learn to waggle yer finger, ye best talk to Magis Sparkmantle in the Thunderbrew Distillery.

[npctext 4295]
text0_0=Och... a paladin?  Well $glad : lass;, ye're in luck!  Azar Stronghammer is back from training and is currently staying at the Thunderbrew Distillery in Kharanos.

[npctext 4297]
text0_0=Well then, it seems we're both looking for Hogral Bakkan.  He's a dwarf to be sure, so sooner or later he'll be heading for the Thunderbrew Distillery for an ale??? he might even be there now.
text1_0=Ye looking for Hogral?  Well did ye check the tavern?  Och!  If yer looking for a rogue, and a dwarf one at that, ye should start in the Inn!  Go have a look already.

[npctext 4298]
text0_0=Warlocks... I don't care for their lot.  Like that Grimrizz who's set up shop outside the Thunderbrew Distillery. The ale will probably go flat there because of him!  Warlocks... bah!
text1_0=That kind of magic is just bad news, I tell ye.  I don't know why that Grimrizz has been allowed to set up outside the Thunderbrew Distillery of all places!  You stay away from him, you here!

[npctext 4299]
text0_0=Och!  Now ye're talkin'!  I bet Granis Swiftaxe could show ye a thing or two about swinging steel.  He's over in the Thunderbrew Distillery in Kharanos at the moment.
text1_0=That Granis Swiftaxe could drink a fish under the table and yet his axe still swings true.  However, if yer looking for training, ye best catch him while ye can understand him.

[npctext 4300]
text0_0=Which profession trainer would ye be looking for?

[npctext 4301]
text0_0=Nope, no alchemists out here in Dun Morogh.  Ye best take a look in Ironforge for them... try the gnomes in Tinker Town.
text1_0=I hear there's a shop up in Ironforge run by the gnomes that specializes in alchemy.  You should go have a look.

[npctext 4302]
text0_0=Och!  Now that's a skill worth knowing.  Tognus beats the anvil with a fury ye don't see often.  Why don't ye go talk him up and see what he can teach ye?
text1_0=Ye can probably hear Tognus beating away on the anvil when yer in Kharanos.  Although, if ye haven't cleared the wax out of yer ears recently, then why don't ye just have a look in the smithy.

[npctext 4303]
text0_0=A Thunderbrew ale and a bit of Gremlock's cooking makes for a nice meal indeed.  Ye really should hit him up for some training if ye want to be a cook.

text0_0=There aren't any enchanters out here in Dun Morogh that I know of.  Ye're going to have to visit Ironforge if ye want to learn the enchanter's profession.
text1_0=Ye should take a look in Ironforge if ye have yer mind set on enchanting.  I think I saw a shop over by the gryphon master last time I was up there.

[npctext 4305]
text0_0=Ye should check over at Steelgrill's Depot for Bronk.  When he's not tinkering with some odd device, he's usually chatting up the pilots about their steam tanks.
text1_0=With all the screws that Bronk has been tightening, I think he's let a few of his own go if ye get me.  All the same he's still got a good head for engineering the darndest devices.  Ye should go pay him a visit over at Steelgrill's Depot.

[npctext 4306]
text0_0=First Aid may not make up for a priest's healing, but it's handy in a pinch.  I recommend ye go talk to Thamner in the Thunderbrew Distillery and learn what ye can.
text1_0=Good ol' Thamner bandaged me up just the other day when I had a run in with a nasty trogg.  I'm good as new I tell ye!  I'm sure Thamner would be happy to show ye how to make a good bandage.

[npctext 4307]
text0_0=Not much fishing to be had around here, but what little there is to be had is Paxton's ye can be sure.  Ye can find him fishing out on Iceflow Lake.
text1_0=Only a few spots to get any fishing done around here.  Paxton knows them all and probably a few he won't tell ya about.  Why don't ye go over to Iceflow Lake and see what he will tell ya.

[npctext 4308]
text0_0=Amazing to see little flowers persist in the cold of Dun Morogh...  but ye won't find any herbalists out here.  Ye'll have to go to Ironforge to get some training in that profession.
text1_0=Nope, nobody who can teach ye herbalism out here.  I think ye'll have better luck in Ironforge though.

[npctext 4310]

[npctext 4313]
text0_0=Ah, Stonebrow doesn't leave Ironforge much these days so if ye're looking to learn the tailor's profession ye'll have to go to see him up in Ironforge.
text1_0=Well, ye won't have much luck with finding a tailor out here.  Ironforge is home to a quite a few talented tailors though.  Why don't ye go ask a guard there.

[npctext 4324]
text0_0=If a hunter is whom you seek, then it is Dazalar that you should visit.  He can usually be found just outside the Inn in Dolanaar.

text0_0=Hello, $c. I've set up camp here at the Bulwark to make my preparations for my journey into the Plaguelands. I've heard rumor that a great human wizard took up residency in Hearthglen not terribly long ago. He was commissioned by the Scarlet Crusade to fashion their warriors and hunters new bows and guns. It's said that he completed a remarkable weapon before the Crusade killed him.$B$BI guess their mistrust of the arcane has grown.

[npctext 4354]
text0_1=Greetings, $c. Don't have too much time to talk--I'm just using Chillwind as a camp to get some rest before heading to Hearthglen. I've heard word that before they went crazy, the Scarlet Crusade had a mage working for them who was trying to create powerful bows and guns for their soldiers. I'm not sure if he succeeded or not... the Crusade killed him before any of his finished product made it out. Maybe they killed him to keep it a secret... or maybe they distrust the arcane that much.

[npctext 4355]
text0_1=He... hello, $N. Sorry, I'm recovering from my wounds.$B$BThose Scarlet Crusaders are tougher than I had given them credit for. They almost did me in.$B$BYou should be careful too. I'd hate to see them get the jump on you.

[npctext 4356]
text0_1=My family worked  the Northridge Lumber Mill in what's now Western Plaguelands. They were dedicated to the Dumah family, and now the Scarlet Crusade have taken it over along with all of Hearthglen!$B$BI will not rest until those zealots are wiped from Azeroth.

[npctext 4357]
text0_0=Long ago, before the last great war, my father ran the Northridge Lumber Mill. It was his life, and he was committed to it. Then the war came, and as much as it pained him, we had to flee to Stormwind.$B$BWe lost a number of friends and family in the those days, and it pains me to know that the Scarlet Crusade has taken the mill for their own ends.$B$BThat's why I've returned.

[npctext 4393]
text0_0=We are the last of the furbolg race... The Timbermaw tribe remains uncorrupted, yet we face the same hostility from outsiders; most believe that it is not possible... that there could actually be furbolg that escaped the corruption...$B$BAngry at those that strive to make enemies too quickly, my brethren now attack any that draw near; they trust no one.$B$BBut perhaps, if you strive to make your presence peaceful with them, they might look upon you as an ally.

[npctext 4394]
text0_0=You must find a way to show that you both are fighting for the same side. Although the Timbermaw may attack you now, if you are diligent, you will find a way.$B$BYou must remember that any attacks on the Timbermaw furbolg directly will greatly hinder your chances of gaining them as an ally.$B$BA good place to start would be the Deadwood furbolg found in many parts of Felwood. These furbolg are the enemy of the Timbermaw tribe, and slaying them would greatly improve your standing with the Timbermaw.

[npctext 4395]
text0_0=We Timbermaw can grant you safe passage through the hold, however, you must prove yourself worthy of our aid.

[npctext 4396]
text0_0=The Winterfall furbolg that reside here in Winterspring were once our allies... But one day, that all changed.$B$BDriven by the strange demands of their high chief, they began to attack all others that they came in contact with, including our tribe. They keep to themselves now...

[npctext 4398]
text0_0=I trust very few of your kind, $N. But I can tell that you are a friend.

[npctext 4399]
text0_0=Yes, yes. I see you.$B$BBe on your way. You may have earned the trust of a few, but it will take more than that to prove it to me!

[npctext 4401]
text0_0=If you prove that you are a true ally, I might consider training you...

We have all suffered many burdens, and if it were not for wisdom and honor, then we would be no better than the Scourge or my people while our blood was tainted by the demon Mannoroth.$B$BIt is your duty to aid the Horde and to defend our way of life. But it is also your duty to know when quarter and compassion should be given to friend and foe alike.$B$BUnderstand this well. This is the new Horde, not some demon-spawned army who lack freewill.

No matter what task I give you, or who I ask you to act against, know that one simple fact.$B$BMany cults exist within the Council, but only to hide its actions against the foolish.$B$BGroups like the Burning Blade, the Argus Wake, and the Searing Blade are all tools of the Council.

It gives Thrall the impression that I am weeding out the evil in the bowels of his great city. The victory is in reality two-fold: kill Thrall's faithful and test the strength of those in the Searing Blade to see if they are truly worthy of joining me.

[npctext 4719]

You hear a voice speak to you as though it was coming from the bear, but the creature makes no indication that it is speaking.$B$B"Greetings, my young friend.  If you have come to me seeking guidance, then perhaps I can help you find what you seek."

[npctext 4721]
text0_0=I represent the strength which bolsters you as a young druid.  You have come to me to learn this strength, young one, and I will teach this to you.  I will teach you all that is the spirit bear, provided you will listen and understand.$B$BIn order to know what it means to draw upon my spirit, you need to understand the importance of the strength of the body, as well as the strength of the heart.

[npctext 4733]
text0_0=Strength of the body is the power and swiftness of action.  You must keep yourself fit at all times, both physically and mentally.  The bear's girth highlights its strength, as it is a ferocious foe in combat.  The bear's girth, however, belies its lithe agility and sharp mind.  These are surprises you will use to your advantage.$B$BYou must rely on the strength of the bear's body in order to master the way of the Claw.

[npctext 4734]
text0_0=Strength of the heart is what gives you the resolve to take action... action that is rooted in intents that are pure and forthright.  To keep the balance is not to be complacent or banal.$B$BYou must show resolve for that which you believe in, and you must be willing to fight for it.  The mother bear shows endless conviction in protecting her young, as does an elder bear protecting his den.  It is this resolve, this strength of heart, which you must come to know if you are to master the way of the Claw.

[npctext 4735]
text0_0=It remains to be seen if you are ready, young one.  Even the wisest and oldest of druids are never truly ready when their ultimate time of testing comes.$B$BYou have heard my words, and now you must move on.  Heed what I have taught you.  There will be a time when you will have your strength tested.  You must face your foe as the bear would - with strength of body and with strength of heart.  Learn from the fight, young one.  Go... with my blessings.

Are they corrupted by the same plague that's touched Felwood? Or perhaps they are simply angry at what's happened to their once peaceful people and now seek to defend themselves. Either way, most of them appear hostile to those who come into the area.

[npctext 4958]
text0_0=The blue dragons themselves aren't here, but followers of Malygos are. I do not know why, but I can tell you this: wherever the blue dragons are, expect to find arcane magic. I wouldn't be surprised if the dragonspawn are here protecting something... perhaps something the Highborne left behind.

[npctext 4959]
text0_1=I should find some hired help; I don't like sitting hear all day selling fish supplies. I'd much rather go fishing, and then sell supplies.

[npctext 4960]
text0_1=Throm-Ka, $c. My mood is poor this day, so please, unless you can help me, I would prefer to be alone.

[npctext 4973]
text0_0=I can not train you, $c.

[npctext 4974]
text0_0=I am Ulysses Rackmore, captain of the Gallant.  And this is the log of the last few days of my doomed ship.$B$BWe were sailing to Feathermoon Stronghold with a shipment of supplies when naga stormed the sides of the Gallant.  We drove them back but we knew they'd return.  Fearing the loss of my most precious belongings, I steered the Gallant to an island off the coast of Desolace, one with old, night elf ruins.  And there I left my treasure chest.

[npctext 4975]
text0_0=My chest is one of ingenious design, and requires two keys to unlock, one gold and one silver.  The first key, the silver key, I gave to my first mate, and I kept the gold.$B$BBut we were doomed to lose them.  My key was lost during the next naga attack, and my first mate's was lost a day later when drysnap makrura assailed us and pulled him into the deep.$B$BI am sure the naga and makrura have the keys.  I am glad the two are enemies and will not share them.

[npctext 4976]
text0_0=After the makrura attack, we could see that the Gallant would not survive another.  So I and the few surviving sailors abandoned my ship.$B$BWe are now ashore and will soon strike out for the town of Nijel's Point, but much danger lies between us and sanctuary, and I fear Desolace will consume us.$B$BI write this now in hopes that someone will know our plight, and some day avenge us against the watery fiends who were our ruin.

[npctext 4978]
text0_1=May Cenarius watch over you, $g brother : sister;.$B$BI am Tajarri, and I am a sworn protector of this shrine.  It is my honor to serve Keeper Remulos as a warden of this sacred land.

text0_0=Before the Scourge came, I had a great business.  I bought and sold everything.  Everything!$B$BAnd my prices were INSANE!$B$BJust ask anyone.  Anyone who's not dead.

[npctext 4980]
text0_0=Hi $N!  Are you here to buy something?  Or maybe sell something?$B$BYou won't find better prices anywhere, or my name isn't Augustus the Touched!

[npctext 4982]
text0_0=This is a dangerous place, $N. Be careful around here.

[npctext 4984]
text0_0=Do not waste my time, $c.

[npctext 4985]
text0_0=I don't train your kind $c.  Find your own trainer before you anger me.

[npctext 4986]
text0_0=Take it easy, mon. I only train da warriors.

[npctext 4987]
text0_0=What kin I do for ya, mon?

[npctext 4988]
text0_0=Due to incompatibility on your class specification, I am unable to help you rectify any situation you have with lack of ability.

[npctext 4989]
text0_0=Excellent! You meet the required parameters and specifications. What can I do for you?

[npctext 4990]
text0_0=Hegnar Rumbleshot, at your service!

[npctext 4991]
text0_0=While Theramore is reknown for it's exceptional training of warriors, I am afraid that I can not help you.

[npctext 4992]
text0_0=Come to train with the Theramore guard have you?

[npctext 4993]
text0_0=I cannot train a $c such as yourself.

[npctext 4994]
text0_0=What can I do for you my child?

[npctext 4996]
text0_0=I can not train you, young one.
unk0_1=2

[npctext 4997]
text0_0=Do you prefer guns or bows?

[npctext 4998]
text0_0=I do not have the knowledge you seek.

[npctext 4999]
text0_0=Wot kin I do fer ye?

[npctext 5000]
text0_0=I kinnae help ye with trainin'. Ye should look fer a $c trainer.

[npctext 5001]
text0_0=What?

[npctext 5002]
text0_0=Don't waste my time.

[npctext 5003]
text0_0=I can not train you.

[npctext 5004]
text0_0=Hey mon, you be needin' to head on over to da $c trainer.

[npctext 5005]
text0_0=The spirits have guided you to me. How may I be of service?

[npctext 5006]
text0_0=May the spirits be with you.

[npctext 5007]
text0_0=Da spirits be strong wit you, mon. What kin dis troll do for ya?

[npctext 5008]
text0_0=May da spirits protect you mon.

[npctext 5009]
text0_0=Where are you going?  Well if you're looking to get there quickly, then look no further!

[npctext 5013]
text0_0=Good day, $gsir:ma'am;. I'd shake your hand, but as you see, I'm in the middle of something. May I be of assistance?

[npctext 5014]
text0_0=You've made a good start, but you still have a great deal to learn, $N.

[npctext 5015]
text0_0=You've already learned everything I can teach you, $N. Talk to the night elf Lilyssia Nightbreeze in the Mage Quarter of Stormwind if you want to continue your studies. I hear she's a good teacher.

[npctext 5016]
text0_1=Shut inside this little house, I dream of joining the battles that rage outside the city walls. Still, duty compels me to share my knowledge with others who fight in my stead... for now.

[npctext 5019]
text0_0=Ishnu-alah, $gbrother:sister;. Have you any tidings from abroad? My heart yearns for news of Teldrassil.

[npctext 5020]
text0_0=I am honored to share my knowledge with you, $N. See that you use it well.

[npctext 5021]
text0_0=You must choose a more experienced teacher, for you have surpassed my abilities. I advise you to speak with Lilyssia Nightbreeze here: she has much knowledge to offer.

[npctext 5022]
text0_1=The druids say that it is only a matter of time until nature itself drives the Horde from Kalimdor. Yet corruption continues to spread throughout our lands, even here on Teldrassil.

[npctext 5023]
text0_1=Well done! Your understanding of potions is coming along nicely.

[npctext 5024]
text0_1=Unfortunately, there is little I can teach someone with your experience, my friend. Seek out the night elf Sylvanna Forestmoon, who resides in the Craftsmen's Terrace of Darnassus.

[npctext 5025]
text0_1=Elune-adore, my $gbrother:sister;. You are welcome here. Speak, and I will do what I can to aid you.

[npctext 5026]
text0_1=Is it not astonishing what one can create from the plants of the forest? Truly, Elune has blessed us with her bounty.

[npctext 5027]
text0_1=You are kind to seek me out, but your skills are beyond my own. Have a word with Sylvanna Forestmoon, just over there. She's been looking for another student.

[npctext 5028]
text0_0=Did my sweet lass Kali send you down to me? The apple of my eye, she is.

[npctext 5029]
text0_0=I don't suppose you're here to talk about my lovely Kali. Fine, then. Potions it is. Anyone ever tell ye you've got a one-track mind?

[npctext 5030]
text0_0=Ye're beyond my skill to teach, $N. Go pester Tally Berryfizz; she's a gnome living in Tinker Town of Ironforge. Oh, and since you're headed up anyway, give Kali my love.

[npctext 5031]
text0_0=Don't let those big, innocent eyes fool ye. Tally's an expert, all right: I learn something new every day. Why d'you think I'm here in Tinker Town? Do I look like an engineer to you? Aye, I didn't think so.

[npctext 5032]
text0_0=Put your back into it, $glad:lass;. Hard work and determination--that's the way! Don't let anyone tell you book learnin' is all ye need.

[npctext 5033]
text0_0=Och, there's nothing I can teach ye, $N. Have a word with Tally Berryfizz over there. She can hardly reach the tables, but when she starts brewing a potion, watch out!

[npctext 5034]
text0_0=You got the look of someone wantin' adventure. Me, I had enough of that by the time we trolls came here. Now I take each day as it comes, an' I train other folks to handle adventures for me.

[npctext 5035]
text0_0=Ready for another lesson? All right, then. First, relax. You gotta stay loose to stir a potion just right.

[npctext 5036]
text0_0=You got questions, but they be too big for me to answer, $N. You be needin' to have words with the orc Yelmak in the Drag of Orgrimmar. He'll help you out.

[npctext 5037]
text0_0=All the bottles on this table are potions I brewed today. And they say a watched pot never boils. Ha!

[npctext 5038]
text0_0=They called me stupid, but I'll show them. I'm going to watch every pot I have and prove that they can all boil stuff anyway. Yeah, I'm on a roll! Who's stupid now, huh? Huh!?

[npctext 5039]
text0_0=Can't help you. You know more about potions than I do. Besides, I have pots to watch. Talk to Yelmak over there. He knows a lot about potions.

[npctext 5040]
text0_0=Bena works like one possessed. Day and night I have seen her bent over these potions, often going without sleep or food. I know our undead allies need help, but I begin to fear she will do herself an injury.

[npctext 5041]
text0_0=I must have broken hundreds of vials when I first began brewing potions. The glass was so fragile in my clumsy hands. I hope you are more cautious than I was.

[npctext 5042]
text0_0=Your capacity for learning has outstripped mine. You will need to talk to Bena Winterhoof over there for further instruction. Please don't take too much of her time, though. She needs her rest.

[npctext 5043]
text0_1=Nice to see a friendly face. I don't get much chitchat from Apothecary Johaan unless he wants something. He's been out of the grave too long. Someday I'll be like that, I hear. Creepy. Maybe by then I won't care.

[npctext 5044]
text0_1=Here to learn about potions? I've got plenty to teach you. I might be dead, but I haven't lost my brains. Yet.

[npctext 5045]
text0_1=I appreciate the company, but let's face it: you have more experience with potions than I do. Talk to Doctor Marsh instead if you want training. He's a Forsaken in the Apothecarium of the Undercity.

[npctext 5046]
text0_0=Once, it is true, I was human. What might otherwise be a shortcoming works to our advantage, $N, for I know human weaknesses intimately.

[npctext 5047]
text0_0=Very well. Cut another lump of flesh from one of these specimens. Let us test what you've learned so far, and we can progress from there.

[npctext 5048]
text0_0=Your knowledge of potions has exceeded mine, but you still have much to learn. Go up the stairs to the southeast and see Doctor Marsh. He will teach you true sufferi--ahem. He is a Forsaken who will train you further.

[npctext 5049]
text0_0=Stop giving me that look. I may not be an adventurer like you, but that doesn't mean I can't have a few muscles. All that stirring makes your arms strong.

[npctext 5050]
text0_0=There's nothing more I can teach you. I've heard of a night elf who might be able to, though. Her name is Ainethil, and she lives in the Craftsmen's Terrace of Darnassus.

[npctext 5051]
text0_0=I'm sorry, $N, but I have no time to spend on novices. You want someone closer to your own skill level. Try the night elf Milla Fairancora, in the Craftsmen's Terrace of Darnassus.

[npctext 5053]
text0_0=You want my help? You got it. What do you need?

[npctext 5054]
text0_1=Don't let the beady eyes and bushy beard fool you. Vosur's a talented apprentice and a good friend, even if I do get a crick in my neck when I talk to him.

[npctext 5055]
text0_1=Um, you already know everything I could teach you. Maybe it's time for you to talk to someone else. Try the night elf Ainethil in the Craftsmen's Terrace of Darnassus. She's got some real talent!

[npctext 5057]
text0_1=That's nice, $N. Go show whatever it is to Vosur over there. He'll answer any questions you have.

[npctext 5058]
text0_1=Who are you and why are you bothering me? Oh, right--potions student. Right. What can I do for you?

[npctext 5059]
text0_1=Ishnu-dal-dieb, $N. Have you come here in search of knowledge?

[npctext 5060]
text0_1=Teaching is not a one-sided trade, $N. As I teach you, I learn more myself, and my understanding grows.

[npctext 5063]
text0_1=Although I am flattered by your confidence in my abilities, teaching you is beyond my skill. You must go to the Craftsmen's Terrace in Darnassus, and speak with the night elf Ainethil. She can help you.

[npctext 5064]
text0_1=Even slight alterations to a potion's ingredients can change it fundamentally. Patience and precision, young one: they will serve you well in all walks of life.

[npctext 5065]
text0_1=My skill at creating potions is inferior to yours. You are ready to speak with Ainethil, just over there. She will understand that you are ready for further instruction.

[npctext 5067]
text0_1=Ah, to be young again, and to have discovered potions for the first time. Thank you for refreshing my memory, $N. Now go share that youthful enthusiasm with Milla Fairancora over there.

[npctext 5068]
text0_1=I have learned much of potions over the long years, $N, and that knowledge is at your disposal. You have only to ask.

[npctext 5069]
text0_0=I'm busy, $N. Tell Whuut to handle whatever it is. That young pup has been stewing all day long. He spends much more time like that, and he's going to hurt something.

[npctext 5070]
text0_0=I'm honored to meet you, $N, but your skill at potions is greater than my own. Go see Doctor Herbert Halsey, an undead in the Apothecarium of the Undercity. He can help you from now on.

[npctext 5072]
text0_0=You're talking to the wrong orc. I don't train novices. Talk to young Whuut over there... and use small words.

[npctext 5073]
text0_0=Another student, eh? All right. I'll see what I can do to help you out.

[npctext 5074]
text0_0=Glyx and I have an understanding: he keeps me supplied, and I keep him rich. Seriously! What that pirate charges me for a measly pouch of crumpled kingsblood... it's enough to make a grown goblin cry.

[npctext 5075]
text0_0=I've got plenty of great recipes for you to take a look at, and at discounted prices, too!

[npctext 5078]
text0_0=You're better at this gig than I am! You want someone with even more experience than I've got. That'd be Ainethil, a night elf lady who lives in the Craftsmen's Terrace of Darnassus.

[npctext 5079]
text0_1=When I first saw the undead, I wept, for I could not imagine their horror and loneliness. The Earth Mother spoke to me then; she sang in my blood. And she told me, "Save them."

[npctext 5080]
text0_1=Can you not sense the anguish of the Earth Mother for her lost children, the undead? Speak quickly, $N. Every second costs me dearly. We must help them find their way back to her!

[npctext 5081]
text0_1=I cannot in good conscience spend time training novices while our allies, the undead, are suffering so terribly. Please speak with Kray over there instead; he can help you for now.

[npctext 5083]
text0_1=Your potion-making skills are beyond mine. Seek out the undead Doctor Herbert Halsey in the Apothecarium of the Undercity. He has the skill to train you further, and you can witness firsthand his people's plight.

[npctext 5084]
text0_0=Another interruption. How am I supposed to get any work done like this? Don't answer that; do I look as if I care what you have to say? Why don't you go bother Mr. High-And-Mighty instead?

[npctext 5085]
text0_0=Me, train you? Come on--we both know I can't. It's this teaching, you see. My own skills suffer. You want training, go to Doctor Herbert Halsey, a Forsaken in the Apothecarium of the Undercity.

[npctext 5088]
text0_0=Another student. Wonderful. This is why Lydon belongs to the Royal Society of Snobs and gets to do research, and I'm stuck being an instructor. If I win another teaching award, I'll never live it down!

[npctext 5089]
text0_0=With Algernon to keep me supplied, I can do all my work here without hunting for a single herb. If I never have to see the wonders of nature again, it won't be too soon.

[npctext 5090]
text0_0=I have no more knowledge to bestow upon you. Go through the archway and down the ramp to the southeast, and talk to Doctor Herbert Halsey. He is a Forsaken who can teach you more advanced techniques.

[npctext 5092]
text0_0=I'm not amused by your audacity in coming to me for training. Go through the archway and down the ramp to the southeast, and talk to Doctor Martin Felben. He is a Forsaken who can teach you the basics.

[npctext 5093]
text0_0=Here to learn? Very well. I suppose you can't cause our allies much harm if I teach you. Just as long as you actually do manage to harm our enemies.

[npctext 5094]
text0_1=This potion seems to heal less damage every time I brew it, though I use the same ingredients. There can be only one conclusion: the plants are changing. I cannot say why or into what.

[npctext 5095]
text0_1=It is time you moved on to a more advanced teacher. In the Feathermoon Stronghold of Feralas dwells the night elf Kylanna Windwhisper. She has a brilliant mind; doubtless she can train you further.

[npctext 5097]
text0_1=Your skill at brewing potions needs to be greater before you can become one of my students. In the meantime, perhaps Sylvanna Forestmoon or Milla Fairancora can help you, just over there.

[npctext 5098]
text0_1=Your education is progressing well. You should be proud of your accomplishments.

[npctext 5099]
text0_0=My colleagues and I are gathering the deadliest substances we know and testing their effects on our enemies. Once I have everything I need, I shall brew such plagues as this world has never seen.

[npctext 5100]
text0_0=Incredible. Your potions display a knowledge that rivals my own. I cannot train you further, but talk to the orc Rogvar of Stonard in the Swamp of Sorrows. He's known for his cutting-edge experiments.

[npctext 5102]
text0_0=You don't yet have the skill to study with me. Go talk to Doctor Martin Felben over there, or go up the ramp to the southeast and see Doctor Marsh. They are Forsaken who can give you the training you need.

[npctext 5103]
text0_0=Ready for training? Then try to keep up, $N. We've got a lot of ground to cover.

[npctext 5104]
text0_1=Once I welcomed darkness, for it was the sister of night. Now it is dark all the time, even during the day, and the forests cry out for sustenance. Unless we act soon, this spreading blight will cover the world.

[npctext 5105]
text0_1=Have you come here for instruction in the art of making potions? You were mistaken if you thought that I would offer such a privilege to you, unearned. Go, and do not return to me until you have greater skill.

[npctext 5106]
text0_1=Your skill displays an enduring affection for our art, but I would see further evidence of your commitment. I shall charge you with a task. Fulfill it, and I will be content.

[npctext 5108]
text0_0=Warchief Thrall himself asked me to come out here. I was honored to obey, and it's no hardship. I couldn't have asked for a better posting than Stonard. Just about any herb I might need grows in the muck here.

[npctext 5110]
text0_0=Hmm, well, I can see that you have a little skill at making potions. Whether you're worthy to be my student remains to be seen, however. I have a job for you. Impress me.

[npctext 5112]
text0_0=Just a minor adjustment here... ah there we go!

[npctext 5113]
text0_0=I would train ye if I could, but ye need the services of someone a bit more... what's the word? Brainy! Look for Trixie Quickswitch in Ironforge. Tell 'er Bronk sent ye!

[npctext 5114]
text0_0=Lookin' to be an engineer, eh? Well, by Muradin, ye've come to the right place!

[npctext 5115]
text0_0=Where's my spinner? I just had it here somewhere...

[npctext 5116]
text0_0=Your current aptitude exceeds my instructional capabilities. You should enquire further with my fellow Gnome Trixie Quickswitch in Ironforge!

[npctext 5117]
text0_0=I would be delighted to aid you in the commencement of your pursuit! Let me grab my spinner and we'll get started...

[npctext 5118]
text0_1=I heard the new Henweigh 6000 will be rolling off the assembly line soon. I can barely contain my excitement!

[npctext 5119]
text0_1=Well... I hate to admit it, but my sister's the one you'll have to talk to if you want to continue training. I don't know as much as she does... yet! She's standing over by the rocket car.

[npctext 5120]
text0_1=I'd love to teach you! Show my sister she's not the only one who knows a thing or two about engineering...

[npctext 5121]
text0_1=Hello there! My name's Jenna! And you?

[npctext 5122]
text0_1=Oh, you've got oodles of things to learn still. I would teach you everything if I could, but I'm still learning too! Why don't you talk to Trixie Quickswitch in Ironforge, she'll help you further your education!

[npctext 5123]
text0_1=You want to train? With me? Fantastic! The only thing better than assembling bullets and explosive devices is to share that knowledge with someone else! Let's get started!

[npctext 5124]
text0_1=Ah, what a beautiful day to blow something up!

[npctext 5125]
text0_1=You need to start learning things that are beyond my expertise! Talk to Lilliam Sparkspindle in front of the tent there. He'll set you on the right course!

[npctext 5126]
text0_1=This kind of work isn't for the faint of heart. I have an uncle who lost a hand! Poor old Stumpy... anyway, if you're still interested I might be able to show you a few things???

[npctext 5127]
text0_0=What? You want something?

[npctext 5128]
text0_0=I can't help ya'! You're ready to see someone who's been at it longer than I have! Let's see... you're an Alliance type, so you need to talk to Lilliam Sparkspindle in Stormwind.

[npctext 5129]
text0_0=Yeah, I'll show you a few things. We'll see how you do, maybe you'll surprise me!

[npctext 5130]
text0_0=(Sniff, sniff) You smell that? Don't you just LOVE the smell of grease?

[npctext 5131]
text0_0=I'm afraid you're out of my league, friend! You should go see Nogg in Orgrimmar, he'll take you to the next level!

[npctext 5133]
text0_0=I like to build stuff. Of course, I like to blow stuff up even more!

[npctext 5134]
text0_0=You know who can really show you some things? Nogg! You go find him in Orgrimmar.

[npctext 5135]
text0_0=I know a few things. You want me to show you?

[npctext 5136]
text0_0=Who says Orcs aren't smart? It takes a lot of brains to be an engineer!

[npctext 5137]
text0_0=You know who's really smart? Nogg! Smarter than me, even. You go tell Nogg Thund sent you! You can find him by the control panel over there.

[npctext 5138]
text0_0=You think you're smart enough? You think you got what it takes? Let's find out!

[npctext 5139]
text0_0=The Dark Lady has said that knowledge will be our greatest weapon in this war.

[npctext 5140]
text0_0=You are ready for greater things! See Franklin Lloyd, to my right. He will guide you from now on.

[npctext 5141]
text0_0=Engineering will provide you with the skills and knowledge to dismantle your opponents! Let me show you how???

[npctext 5142]
text0_0=I'm never too busy to speak to a stranger! Almost never, anyway...

[npctext 5143]
text0_0=You're working your way up??? higher than me, at this point! You should talk to Springspindle Fizzlegear in Ironforge! (He'll? She'll?) show you more than I ever could!

[npctext 5144]
text0_0=I can show you a few tricks... if you don't mind doing a little something first, that is.

[npctext 5145]
text0_0=Hmm??? well, I can't help you quite yet! You have to learn the basics first. Why don't you go see Sprite Jumpsprocket in Stormwind!

[npctext 5146]
text0_0=Fantastic! Aren't you the industrious one? Well, let's get started, shall we?

[npctext 5147]
text0_0=Let's see... fourteen plus seven, carry the two... oh, yes?

[npctext 5148]
text0_0=Well, you're just zooming right along! I can't teach you anything you don't already know, but Springspindle Fizzlegear sure can! You can find Sprinspindle in Ironforge. Good luck!

[npctext 5149]
text0_0=Quid pro quo! I'll teach you what I know, but first I want you to perform a small task???

[npctext 5150]
text0_0=You can learn from me in time??? but not yet! Why don't you start out by talking to Sprite Jumpsprocket to my right here. You can check in with me after you've gotten your feet wet!

[npctext 5151]
text0_0=You certainly did not disappoint! Now that we've gotten that out of the way, your instruction may begin!

[npctext 5152]
text0_1=The plans for my twenty-foot tall turkey baster are nearly complete! Now all I need is a twenty-foot tall turkey...

[npctext 5153]
text0_1=Don't tell anyone else I said this, but even I don't know everything! If you want to keep learning, you should talk to the owner of the shop, Springspindle Fizzlegear.

[npctext 5154]
text0_1=You'll need to prove your worthiness before I go giving away my secrets! I've got just the test for you...

[npctext 5155]
text0_1=Close, but no cigar! I'm afraid you'll have to talk to my sis, Jemma first. After she's gone over the basics with you, come see me and I'll show you the juicy stuff!

[npctext 5156]
text0_1=Not bad, for a beginner! I guess it couldn't hurt for me to show you a few things...

[npctext 5157]
text0_0=If there were just a few more hours in a day...

[npctext 5158]
text0_0=You have earned the privilege of training with a higher instructor. Go see my pal Roxxik there.

[npctext 5159]
text0_0=Every day is a test, and this day is no different. If you pass this test, I will share some of my knowledge...

[npctext 5160]
text0_0=You have not yet earned the right to train with me. See Thund first, over by the table. Come back when he says you're ready!

[npctext 5161]
text0_0=You have passed your test, well done! Your training may now continue.

[npctext 5162]
text0_0=I don't have time for idle gossip, I'm a professional!

[npctext 5163]
text0_0=What do you think I could teach you? Roxxik would do a much better job. You can find him in Orgrimmar. Now be off!

[npctext 5164]
text0_0=Let's see how competent you are, shall we? If you perform this task to my liking, I'll spend the time to teach you!

[npctext 5165]
text0_0=This is a waste of time, mine and yours! Go see Graham Van Talen if you want to begin your instruction! He's standing to my left over there.

[npctext 5167]
text0_0=If my calculations are correct, the wheel will soon be obsolete!

[npctext 5168]
text0_0=You have certainly come a long way in your training. There is only one instructor who can train you further. Find Buzzek Bracketswing in Gadgetzan!

[npctext 5170]
text0_0=The things I would teach you would turn your brain to jelly! Come back when you've learned sufficiently!

[npctext 5171]
text0_0=Excellent, you have proven yourself worthy! Now for the next phase of your instruction...

[npctext 5172]
text0_0=Sometimes I surprise even myself!

[npctext 5173]
text0_0=I can't teach what I don't know! If only there was someone else who knew more than I do... wait, there is! Go see Buzzek Bracketswing in Gadgetzan!

[npctext 5175]
text0_0=Nice try, but you'll need some more experience before training with me! Back to the trenches!

[npctext 5176]
text0_0=Nice going! I knew I was right about you, no matter what those other people said. Ha! I'm kidding! Okay, on with your lessons???

[npctext 5177]
text0_0=I've been working on a way to transport oil underground between major cities, but everyone tells me it's a pipe dream.

[npctext 5179]
text0_0=Show me what you got! You won't be sorry, I promise!

[npctext 5180]
text0_0=I would never turn away someone who's ready to train with me. Unfortunately, you're not! You've still got a ways to go kid!

[npctext 5181]
text0_1=Hail, traveler! What brings you to my doorstep?

[npctext 5182]
text0_1=I'm afraid I have nothing to teach to someone with your experience. But you haven't reached the end of the road yet. Speak to Lucan Cordell, behind the counter there. He'll guide you through the next phase of your journey.

[npctext 5183]
text0_1=Hmm... well you seem capable enough. If you truly desire to learn, then nothing will stand in your way! I will guide you through your first steps on what I hope will be a long and fulfilling path.

[npctext 5184]
text0_0=There are ways to strengthen steel beyond the hammer and forge, young wanderer. Care to learn more?

[npctext 5185]
text0_0=Ye're a fine enchanter indeed! Now it's time fer ye to move on. I want ye to talk to Gimble Thistlefuzz, upstairs. He's a bit of a character, but he'll steer ye in the right direction from here on out!

[npctext 5186]
text0_0=Ah, ye're an inquisitive one, are ye'? Excellent! Pay close attention, this just might save yer skin when the goin' gets rough!

[npctext 5187]
text0_1=The Goddess has granted me wisdom, stranger. If it is her will, I shall pass it on to you.

[npctext 5188]
text0_1=Your skills are beyond my reach. It is time for you to face new challenges. Taladan will help you prepare. He is standing by the table there.

[npctext 5189]
text0_1=I will teach you what I can. Each lesson is a gift from the Goddess herself. Use her gifts wisely, and you shall not falter.

[npctext 5190]
text0_1=Elune's secrets are many, but they are not to be shared with just anyone.

[npctext 5191]
text0_1=You have truly accelled in your knowledge of enchanting. There is much more to learn, if you are willing. Speak to Taladan, in the Craftsmen's Terrace in Darnassus.

[npctext 5192]
text0_1=Open your mind, wanderer, and we shall begin.

[npctext 5193]
text0_0=I do not have time to waste, stranger. State your business or be off!

[npctext 5194]
text0_0=Eh, well you've made it this far... go see Lavinia Crowe by the other bookshelf there. If you don't mess things up with her, maybe you can learn some more.

[npctext 5195]
text0_0=You don't look like much to me, but who knows, maybe there's an enchanter hidden in there somewhere!

[npctext 5196]
text0_0=What I wouldn't give to be out on the open plains on a day like this... but, my duty binds me.

[npctext 5197]
text0_0=I cannot teach you anything you don't already know. However, the knowledge of my father far surpasses my own. Go inside and speak to him. Good luck!

[npctext 5198]
text0_0=There are many secrets that may be unlocked with patience and determination. Now, let us begin...

[npctext 5199]
text0_0=Throm-ka! What you looking for, stranger?

[npctext 5200]
text0_0=You come to wrong place. Talk to the expert Godan over there. You learn more from him.

[npctext 5201]
text0_0=To die in battle is glorious! But, with what I teach you, maybe you not die so quickly, hm?

[npctext 5202]
text0_0=Who are you? What do you want from me?

[npctext 5203]
text0_0=What do I look like, the Grand Poobah of enchanters? Your skills require the guidance of an Artisan! Go find Kitta Firewind at the Tower of Azora.

[npctext 5204]
text0_0=Great, let's get started... ha! Fooled you! Surely you didn't think it would be that simple. You'll need to prove your mettle just like everyone else!

[npctext 5205]
text0_0=You're joking, right? I believe you're looking for the OTHER short fellow, Thonys Pillarstone. He's downstairs. Now skedaddle!

[npctext 5206]
text0_0=Okay, well??? don't get cocky! Since you have demonstrated  your competence though, we may now begin!

[npctext 5207]
text0_0=If you have what it takes, I will be happy to show you the way.

[npctext 5208]
text0_0=A true professional know his limitations, and I'm not ashamed to admit that your skills exceed mine. I want you to pay a visit to Kitta Firewind at the Tower of Azora. She is well-renowned, and with good reason.

[npctext 5209]
text0_0=You seem confident. Surely you wouldn't mind a test of your skills?

[npctext 5210]
text0_0=You are not ready. Speak to Betty Quinn, she's standing by the stairs over there. Return to me when you have achieved a higher enlightenment.

[npctext 5211]
text0_0=Your confidence is well-founded, traveler. Now your true education may begin!

[npctext 5212]
text0_0=If you seek to hunt naga, then you will need all the help you can get. Deep in the water you can find bubbly fissures that produce enough air bubbles that will allow you to breath underwater. Swim up close so that you can use the bubbles.

[npctext 5213]
text0_0=It is true I have skills to teach to those who are worthy. Would that be you?

[npctext 5214]
text0_0=You are an exceptional enchanter. Beyond my talents as a teacher, I fear. Seek out Kitta Firewind at the Tower of Azora. Only she can qualify as your instructor now.

[npctext 5215]
text0_0=I believe you are up to this task??? will you accept the challenge?

[npctext 5216]
text0_0=You have not yet learned the basics, wanderer. Have you spoken to my assistant, Lalina Summermoon? Perhaps you should.

[npctext 5217]
text0_0=Fine work! You are truly deserving of the knowledge I shall bestow upon you!

[npctext 5218]
text0_1=If you are seeking a truly rewarding pursuit, then a life of enchanting is for you!

[npctext 5219]
text0_1=I know many things, stranger, but your knowledge rivals my own. Enchanters who wish to hone their skills further are known to travel to the Tower of Azora, where an artisan named Kitta Firewind resides.

[npctext 5220]
text0_1=Why don't we see just what you're capable of? If you complete the task I shall be happy to further your training!

[npctext 5223]
text0_0=Enchanting has run in our family for generations. I learned at an early age, just as my son is doing now.

[npctext 5224]
text0_0=There is one whose knowledge exceeds my own. You are ready to seek her out. Go to Sun Rock Retreat in Stonetalon Mountains. Find Hgarth, and continue your training.

[npctext 5225]
text0_0=I will teach you??? soon. I require a demonstration of your loyalty, first.

[npctext 5226]
text0_0=Surely Mot didn't send you to me? He knows better. You are not yet capable of understanding what I would teach you. See my son Mot, just outside there, and finish training with him.

[npctext 5227]
text0_0=Ah, very good. I am satisfied that you are a worthy student. Now, your training with me may begin???

[npctext 5228]
text0_1=I don't get many visitors.  You're looking for something specific, yes?

[npctext 5229]
text0_1=If I wasn't stuck here day in and day out, I would have attained the mastery required to train the likes of you! Unfortunately that's not the case. Go talk to Hgarth at the Sun Rock Retreat in the Stonetalon Mountains.

[npctext 5230]
text0_1=Hmm, you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours. If you do what I ask, and do it well, maybe we can discuss your training.

[npctext 5231]
text0_1=No, no, you'll need FAR more training before you're ready to learn from me! Go talk to that uptight dabbler Malcomb Wynn. He's the one buried in books over there.

[npctext 5232]
text0_1=Well, I've seen better. But, you have potential, I won't deny it. Pay attention and you just might learn something!

[npctext 5233]
text0_0=Greetings, traveler! Care to delve into the mysteries of the arcane? Hm?

[npctext 5238]
text0_0=Some adventurers think enchanting doesn't work. I find that when I challenge them to battle they change their tune!

[npctext 5239]
text0_0=Your skills are out of my league, stranger.Talk to Hgarth at the Sun Rock Retreat in the Stonetalon Mountains. He will provide you with more knowledge than I can.

[npctext 5240]
text0_0=You may have what it takes. Let's find out!

[npctext 5241]
text0_0=You are unfit to train with me, stranger. Spend some time with my assistant Jhag over there.

[npctext 5242]
text0_0=Well done! You have that spark in your eye??? I know it well, it's the same spark I had when I was but a pup! Now, let's see if I can't teach you something.

[npctext 5243]
text0_1=What brings you to the Tower?

[npctext 5244]
text0_1=You have nearly reached the pinnacle of your training. To become the greatest enchanter you can possibly be, you have one more instructor to seek out. Her name is Annora, and you may find her in Uldaman.

[npctext 5246]
text0_1=You are eager, that is good. However, you are not yet ready to train with the likes of me.

[npctext 5247]
text0_1=Your skills are truly becoming extraordinary. Now, let us continue your training...

[npctext 5248]
text0_0=Have you come to seek the knowledge of Hgarth?

[npctext 5249]
text0_0=There is only one whose skills exceed my own. You are ready to receive her knowledge. She is Annora, and you may find her... in Uldaman.

[npctext 5251]
text0_0=Train hard, train every day. And when you have perfected your skills, return to me.

[npctext 5252]
text0_0=You have reached new heights in your path to mastery. Let us see if we can take you even further???

[npctext 5253]
text0_1=Greetings traveler, you have my undying gratitude for dispensing with those dreadful creatures! I was beginning to think I might have to hide out forever!

[npctext 5255]
text0_1=Your education is nearly complete. One final task is all that stands between you and the culmination of all your efforts???

[npctext 5256]
text0_1=There are still lessons you must learn from others before my knowledge may be shared with you. Be diligent, and do not give up hope.

[npctext 5257]
text0_0=Greetings $N.
text0_1=Since my husband left for the front, Helene here has been my strength. Her kind heart and sharp sword have helped me through a lot of tough times. I don't know what I would've done without her.

[npctext 5258]
text0_1=Gosh, I'm sorry. I don't have anything new to teach you. How about you go talk to Simon Tanner in the Old Town section of Stormwind? He's a human with big muscles and dreamy red hair.

[npctext 5259]
text0_1=How's it going? I love the smell of leather; don't you?

[npctext 5260]
text0_0=I already know a lot about style. Now it's just a matter of mastering the techniques for working with leather. Good thing Simon's a real sport about helping me learn them.

[npctext 5261]
text0_0=There's nothing I can teach you, other than maybe a better eye for color and detail. Talk to Simon Tanner over there; he knows a lot of advanced techniques for working with leather.

[npctext 5262]
text0_0=This outfit really brings out the blue in my eyes, don't you think? It should be obvious I have plenty of skill to go around, so I can afford to share a few of my tricks of the trade. Listen up, okay?

[npctext 5263]
text0_1=Welcome to our home, $N. Radnaal and I have little to offer, but you are welcome to what hospitality we can provide.

[npctext 5264]
text0_1=My apologies, but you have already learned everything I know. The night elf Faldron could offer you further training, however. Look for him in the Craftsmen's Terrace of Darnassus.

[npctext 5265]
text0_1=You need to make your stitches smaller, $N. Fewer items will slip out of your quivers and ammo pouches. Besides, no one likes a lumpy tunic.

[npctext 5273]
text0_1=If you're interested in sewing with leather, you've certainly come to the right place. Faldron and Telonis are true artists, and I hope to learn much from them.

[npctext 5274]
text0_1=Oh, I'm sorry, but you know more about leather than I do at this point. Talk to Faldron over there if you wish to learn more.

[npctext 5275]
text0_1=It's so exciting to be here in Darnassus, surrounded by talented people! I just know I'm going to make my family proud. Maybe if I'm really lucky, the Sentinels will ask me to join their forces on the front!

[npctext 5276]
text0_1=This hide isn't ready to work with yet. I wish it didn't take so long to make leather. There has to be some way to cut down on all this waiting. It can't be good for my health, you know?

[npctext 5277]
text0_1=Aww, what rotten luck! My skills aren't good enough to be of any use to you. Oh well. Talk to Fimble Finespindle over there by the loom. He's been working with leather for longer than I have.

[npctext 5278]
text0_1=Oh, goody, something else to do while I wait! You're a real life-saver, $N!

[npctext 5279]
text0_1=You like the rug? I killed and skinned the beast myself. May all the centaur fall as easily.

[npctext 5280]
text0_1=I have nothing more to teach you. Talk to Karolek if you wish to further your leatherworking skills.

[npctext 5281]
text0_1=Too bad we can't skin the humans and their allies. All that skin is just going to waste. Still, who'd want to wear the flimsy leather you could make out of it?

[npctext 5282]
text0_1=Skin, glorious skin. It holds your insides... in. You might've noticed my skin's not doing so well. To think I used to worry about my pores. Hardly any skin left to worry about these days. In a way, it's very freeing.

[npctext 5283]
text0_1=You've got the hang of it. I can't teach you any more, but talk to Arthur Moore, a Forsaken who works in the Rogues' Quarter of the Undercity. Tell him I sent you.

[npctext 5284]
text0_1=Before the plague came, I knew nothing about leather. Now I know enough to teach others. Death's left me with a lot of time on my hands.

[npctext 5285]
text0_0=Meat, skin, bones... a good hunter lets nothing go to waste. Every scrap of leather can be salvaged, perhaps to reinforce an ally's armor. Thus, each of us is strong alone, but together we become invincible.

[npctext 5286]
text0_0=You have outgrown any teachings I could offer. Go with the blessing of the Earth Mother. Seek out the tauren Tarn in the northwestern shops of Thunder Bluff's central plateau. Be guided by his wisdom.

[npctext 5287]
text0_0=We live and die, and the land remains, eternal, unmoved by our passage. Thus, land cannot belong to us, $N. Instead, we belong to it. Therefore we protect the land, for without it we cannot hope to survive.

[npctext 5288]
text0_0=The caverns below us are a source of strange and wondrous hides, but you must take care if you venture into their depths, $N. Remember that your own skin is far more valuable.

[npctext 5289]
text0_0=Your understanding of leather is deeper than my own. Perhaps you should visit the tauren Krulmoo Fullmoon in Camp Taurajo of the Barrens. He has much knowledge to offer a student of your talents.

[npctext 5291]
text0_0=Cairne himself lives here, they say. Once I have finished crafting a fitting gift, I will seek him out. Perhaps he will have words of wisdom for me.

[npctext 5292]
text0_0=Your talent is beyond my own, friend. Speak with Tarn here; his knowledge of leather is much greater than mine. I'm sure he would welcome another student.

[npctext 5293]
text0_0=Cleanse your hands before you begin any project. Staining the leather with blood or dirt would take away from its natural beauty.

[npctext 5295]
text0_0=I can't help you; your work is beyond my own. Talk to Arthur Moore, over there by the coffins. He'll be able to train you further.

[npctext 5296]
text0_0=Take every word I say and commit it to memory. Until our enemies have been eradicated, we must never shirk a chance to further our knowledge. Reinforce your armor, and never relax your guard.

[npctext 5314]
text0_1=You are beyond my limited abilities. Seek out the night elf Ainethil in the Craftsmen's Terrace of Darnassus. She can teach you more. I only wish that I could go with you.

[npctext 5316]
text0_1=My teachings would be too advanced for you at this stage. If you wish to learn more of potions, speak with Tel'Athir here instead.

[npctext 5317]
text0_1=Listen carefully, $N, for I have much knowledge to impart.

[npctext 5319]
text0_0=Not bad... I suppose training you is not out of the question. Very well! Let's begin???

[npctext 5320]
text0_0=Randal's a bit of a dandy, but he's dependable, which is more than I can say for a lot of the students I take on. Still, I guess I can't blame them for wanting a bit of adventure.

[npctext 5321]
text0_0=Sorry, but you've reached the limit of what I can teach. If you want to learn more, go see Telonis in the Craftsmen's Terrace of Darnassus. He's pretty talented, so I hear.

[npctext 5323]
text0_0=Come back to me when you've had more training. Randal Worth over there can help you with that.

[npctext 5324]
text0_0=Hmm, I guess I can take on another student. Well, don't just stand there. Tell me what you're looking to learn.

[npctext 5325]
text0_0=Darianna shows promise, but she is so full of energy that it is hard for her to stay still and listen. With her strength and agility, I fear it won't be long before she is called to fight. We must teach her quickly.

[npctext 5326]
text0_0=If you are here for further training, you have overestimated my abilities. Have a word with Telonis over there; he can help you.

[npctext 5328]
text0_0=In time you will be ready for what I have to teach, $N. Until then, please ask Darianna over there to help you with your training.

[npctext 5329]
text0_0=Many animals lost their lives so that we could gain these materials. Do not take their sacrifice lightly, $N. Handle the leather with the respect it deserves.

[npctext 5330]
text0_0=Lots to do! Haven't been this busy since my cousin accidentally vaporized all the cloth and leather in Gnomeregan. My, it was drafty for a while! Ah, $N, those were the days....

[npctext 5331]
text0_0=Nope, can't help you, I'm afraid. Your skills have mine beat! If you want to learn more, talk to the night elf Telonis in the Craftsmen's Terrace of Darnassus. He's amazing!

[npctext 5333]
text0_0=Well, I declare! It's a new student! I'll gladly teach you everything I know once you have a little more skill. Go talk to Gretta Finespindle over there, would you? She'll have you up to speed in no time.

[npctext 5334]
text0_0=Your skills are coming along nicely. Soon you'll be running a leather shop of your own. I'll be glad for the help, $N. My hands are only so fast, you know? There's so much work to do!

[npctext 5335]
text0_0=The strongest hides come from those kodo that have laid themselves to rest in this wasteland.

[npctext 5336]
text0_0=I cannot aid you with further lessons: your skills have surpassed mine. Go and see the tauren Una in the northwestern shops of Thunder Bluff's central plateau. She offers more advanced training.

[npctext 5338]
text0_0=I do not offer apprentice training. Look for the tauren Waldor in the Wailing Caverns, here in the Barrens. He can assist you with whatever you need.

[npctext 5339]
text0_0=Have you come for further training? Shake the dust of the road from your garments, then, and let us get to work.

[npctext 5340]
text0_0=My axe has seen many battles, and I like to keep it handy. Enemy forces have fought their way into our capital several times now, but have no fear: we have always driven them back.

[npctext 5341]
text0_0=I cannot help you with further training: your skill at working with leather rivals my own. You should speak with Una, over there. I will vouch for your skill if need be.

[npctext 5343]
text0_0=Your skills are insufficient to learn what I teach. Try talking to Mak over there instead. He can help you out until you're ready for more advanced lessons.

[npctext 5344]
text0_0=I am pleased with your progress so far. Surely the Earth Mother has inspired your hands.

[npctext 5345]
text0_0=We have only a small foothold on this continent for now, but the humans can't fight us off forever. Then they'll pay for enslaving us. We'll cut their lying tongues out for their treachery.

[npctext 5346]
text0_0=I'd train you if I could, but you're too much for me. Tell you what: go talk to the tauren Una in the northwestern shops of Thunder Bluff's central plateau. She's got some real talent.

[npctext 5350]
text0_0=Am I busy? What's that supposed to mean? Do you think I just stand here all day, twiddling my thumbs? If you're here to buy something, talk to Handor.

[npctext 5351]
text0_0=You won't learn anything new from me; you know too much already. If you want more training, talk to the tauren Una in the northwestern shops of Thunder Bluff's central plateau. Send her my regards, eh?

[npctext 5353]
text0_0=You can't study my techniques until you've learned the basics. Speak with Kamari if you are interested in training.

[npctext 5354]
text0_0=The twists and turns of Orgrimmar are designed to thwart invaders. Can you imagine how quickly one of those puny gnomes would get lost in here? Ha! If it was lucky, I'd track it down and keep it as a pet.

[npctext 5355]
text0_0=Before my death, I was a librarian; I had nothing to do with wars and plagues. I never asked to become this. On the other hand, now that my mind is my own again, I'm not about to surrender without a fight.

[npctext 5356]
text0_0=I'm pleased to say that your talents have outpaced my own. Go away now. Err, try the tauren Una in the northwestern shops of Thunder Bluff's central plateau. She's very skilled, I assure you.

[npctext 5359]
text0_0=I first set up shop in the Magic Quarter, but it was pretty noisy there. This is a definite improvement, barring a few persistent students who still track me down, despite the fact that I've relocated.

[npctext 5360]
text0_1=Elune has granted the night elves many gifts. In return, it is our responsibility to safeguard these forests from the demonic taint that the Horde always brings with it.

[npctext 5361]
text0_1=Training you further is beyond my abilities. Speak to Telonis in the Craftsmen's Terrace of Darnassus. He is always glad to help talented students.

[npctext 5363]
text0_1=I only teach students who have already mastered the basics. You must seek out the night elf Darianna in the Craftsmen's Terrace of Darnassus. Her skills will be a perfect complement to yours.

[npctext 5364]
text0_1=Always double-check your measurements before you begin to cut the leather. We cannot afford to waste materials.

[npctext 5373]
text0_0=The waters of Westfall is where you must search, due west-northwest of where the Gold Coast Quarry meets with the shore.  An anchor shows where a boat has sunk beyond it, deep within the water.  The underwater pressure is fierce here; swimming too far will crush even the mightiest swimmer from fatigue.  $B$BLook for a natural formation to aid you, $N - a bubbly fissure is near here, offering deep-water swimmers a chance for renewed breath.
unk0_1=1

[npctext 5374]
text0_0=In the Silverpine Forest along the edges of the North Tide's Run, a derelict boat rests on the shore.  Out to the west of this lies what you seek; swim too far and the ocean will crush you from fatigue.  It resides on the ocean floor in a lockbox, waiting for you to claim it.$B$BYou'll be hard pressed to survive a dive to such depths without aid, so take heart; a bubbly fissure offers renewed breath to divers seeking this half of the pendant.  Use it wisely.

text0_1=In the northern part of Darkshore runs the Cliffspring River, flowing down from the lands now known as Felwood.  As the river flows out and empties out into the Mist's Edge, travel north to where deepest parts of the ocean begin.  A stone formation that some call the Stone Claw due it its shape is where you may find what you seek.$B$BBe warned - threshers gather by the Stone Claw, and will attack those who trespass on their territory.

text0_1=In the northeastern Barrens lies a pool of water sickened by pollution.  The locals call it the Sludge Fen; the Venture Company has turned the once crystal-blue waters into a mire of industrial byproducts and waste.  In the heart of this fen lies what you seek, $N.$B$BBe warned - the Venture Company does not tolerate trespassers, and they consider anyone who does not work for them as such.  You'll especially be a target as a protector of nature, something they vehemently oppose.

text0_0=The grass is soft and lush. The air is fresh, full of light and song. Everything I've seen suggests that Teldrassil is a dream come true. Why, then, is my heart full of foreboding?

[npctext 5394]
text0_0=You have advanced beyond my skill to teach you. Journey now to Aerie Peak in the Hinterlands and speak with the dwarf Drakk Stonehand. His work is magnificent, far better than my own.

[npctext 5396]
text0_0=I regret to say that I cannot aid you, $gnoble sir:gentle lady;, until you learn more of working with leather. Speak with Faldron or Darianna here instead. They can teach you the skill you require.

[npctext 5397]
text0_0=Do not try to force your will upon the leather. Rather, let its natural tendencies dictate what form and function it will take. This is not a battle to be won. Work with the leather, not against it.

[npctext 5398]
text0_1=The needle is small, but the thread is strong, and the stitches are fine. Our pact with Thrall and the others will hold. The Horde will not be driven from these lands.

[npctext 5399]
text0_1=Even my talents have a limit, and you have reached it. Congratulations, $N. Your next stop should be Camp Mojache in Feralas. The tauren Hahrana Ironhide lives there; she is renowned for her skill.

[npctext 5401]
text0_1=It's been so long since I was a novice myself that I don't think I'd be the best teacher for you. Try talking to Tarn or Mak, right over there. One of them should be able to answer your questions.

[npctext 5402]
text0_1=Cairne has brought us to a land rich with possibilities for the future. We have been fortunate, and so in turn we pass on our good fortune to others. That is why I began teaching, $N.

[npctext 5403]
text0_0=I can make amazing things with the materials I find out here. By Muradin's beard, there are fantastic creatures in these hills! Go have a whack at them, $N, and bring me back some tall tales.

[npctext 5405]
text0_0=I love a good challenge; don't you? Aye, of course ye do. An' that's why you're about to do exactly what I say.

[npctext 5406]
text0_0=I'm not here to teach babes fresh out of the cradle. Ye've nowhere near the amount of skill I require in my students. In fact, ye're a sad figure of a $glad:lass;, an' I'll thank ye not to stand there jibber-jabberin' at me.

[npctext 5407]
text0_1=All requests for my work must be made in person by the buyer. Orwin often asks me to reconsider, but my priorities lie here. Look around you: many of these fighters rely upon me for their armor.

[npctext 5409]
text0_1=We cannot afford to give an inch in this war. Day and night, I create new armor, and I patch whatever can be salvaged from the old. I have no time for other tasks. Would you take care of something for me?

[npctext 5410]
text0_1=You have wasted your time and mine by coming to me for training, $N. I have no time to teach basic skills. We're fighting a war here, and this is one of the front lines. Don't return to me until you are more prepared.

[npctext 5413]
text0_0=I can tell that your wardrobe is in dire need of care.

[npctext 5414]
text0_0=I'm a simple man who knows a few things about tailoring, but you need more assistance than I can provide. I have heard of a Night Elf who is quite an accomplished tailor. He resides in Stormwind, in the Magic District.

[npctext 5415]
text0_0=So you would like to learn a few things? I would be happy to get you started!

[npctext 5416]
text0_0=Life is like a carefully woven tapestry.

[npctext 5417]
text0_0=Hmm... the things you need to learn are a little above my head. Have a talk with Sellandus over at Larson's Clothiers just up the path to the right. He taught me everything I know!

[npctext 5418]
text0_0=Very well, let your journey of tailoring begin.

[npctext 5419]
text0_0=Needlework requires a steady hand. And patience... above all, patience.

[npctext 5420]
text0_0=It is time for you to journey to Darnassus and speak to Me'lynn. She will guide you from now on.

[npctext 5421]
text0_0=I would be happy to take you under my wing. Let us begin.

[npctext 5422]
text0_0=Welcome to me shop. What can I do for ye'?

[npctext 5423]
text0_0=Hold on there, I'm just an assistant. If ye want to start learnin' the fancy stuff, talk to old Stonebrew over there.

[npctext 5424]
text0_0=Excellent! I've been hopin' for a new student. Well, let's get started right away then!

[npctext 5425]
text0_0=We use many animal pelts and skins in our creations.

[npctext 5426]
text0_0=I know a few things, but I'm no expert. Lucky for you, Magar is. He's standing near the back of the shop. See if he can help you, but be careful not to rile him. He can be irritable.

[npctext 5427]
text0_0=I will teach you what I can.

[npctext 5428]
text0_0=No part of the animals we hunt is wasted.

[npctext 5429]
text0_0=You seek a higher knowledge. Tepa is blessed with such knowledge. She should be standing somewhere nearby...

[npctext 5430]
text0_0=With the Earth Mother's blessing, we shall begin.

[npctext 5431]
text0_0=Pleased to make you acquaintance. May I help you?

[npctext 5432]
text0_0=I am knowledgable, but I am not an expert. You know who you should talk to? Rhiannon! She's not far. Ask around for her in Undercity

[npctext 5433]
text0_0=So... you want to be a tailor? Very well, we'll see if you have what it takes.

[npctext 5434]
text0_0=We don't get many visitors out here. May I interest you in something?

[npctext 5435]
text0_0=I'm just a student myself, really. Rhiannon's the expert. She's standing by the crates over there. You can learn a lot from her.

[npctext 5436]
text0_0=Yes, I think you have potential. Maybe I can show you a thing or two.

[npctext 5437]
text0_1=There is no greater way to clear the mind than to weave.

[npctext 5438]
text0_1=My education is ongoing, and your knowledge surpasses mine. If you wish to learn more you must speak to Me'lynn. She will guide you.

[npctext 5439]
text0_1=You will not be disappointed, traveler. Tailoring is a joyous endeavor.

[npctext 5440]
text0_0=Hey mon, what can I be doin' for you?

[npctext 5441]
text0_0=At dis point you know as much as I do, mon. Maybe you go see Magar in Orgrimmar. He not be da happiest tailor around, but he help you anyway.

[npctext 5442]
text0_0=Dat's da attitude! Grab a needle and thread and let's get jammin'!

[npctext 5443]
text0_0=I am afraid that I am no longer gentle or humble. Age and countless battles have hardened my skin and soul. Perhaps that is why Cairne assigned me to Sun Rock Retreat... the gentle winds and warm sun does ease the pain.

[npctext 5453]
text0_0=Greetings.  Our bats are well trained and fed.  You'll not find faster.

[npctext 5454]
text0_0=How may I be of service?

[npctext 5455]
text0_0=Greetings, and welcome.  I am not very good at smiling, but trust me; I am happy to serve you.

[npctext 5473]
text0_1=The Hippogryph is a noble beast, proud and swift.  They are an honor to train, and can quickly take their rider a great distance.

[npctext 5474]
text0_0=To maintain our link to the mainland, we have hippogryphs constantly flying between Rut'theran Village and Darkshore.

[npctext 5475]
text0_1=The fish off the coast of Teldrassil are quite large and robust.  Rumors say it is the speedy growth of our new world tree that is the cause.

[npctext 5476]
text0_0=Although the coast of Darkshore is more dangerous than that of Teldrassil, many fishers find profit here.

[npctext 5477]
text0_0=It is my honor to provide for adventurers, for they are heroes in the making.

[npctext 5479]
text0_0=Fastest gryphons this side of Aerie Peak. Want to take a ride?

[npctext 5480]
text0_0=On the northern dock, you can board a ship that will carry you to Rutheran Village and Darnassus.  From the southern dock, you can find passage across the Great Sea to Menethil Harbor on Khaz Modan.  Safe journeys to you!

[npctext 5481]
text0_0=This dock here?  Well you can catch the ship that goes to that Night Elf place.  What's it's name?  Uhh Auberdine I think.  I don't really know for sure, I just load and unload stuff.

[npctext 5494]

text0_0=My wind riders are trained to fly quickly through the hot Barrens air.

[npctext 5496]
text0_0=The Barrens, with its hot sun and hostile denizens, is the perfect place to test your strength and fortitude.

[npctext 5497]
text0_0=Greetings.  If you are here for leather goods, then you will find my wares well crafted.

[npctext 5498]
lang0=7
text0_0=Are you here to help with the delivery? Miran's just about ready.

[npctext 5500]

[npctext 5501]

text0_0=This is a dangerous line of business!$B$BMiran just left with a delivery. He should be back in a few minutes.

[npctext 5513]
text0_0=You're better at this gig than I am! You want someone with even more experience than I've got. That'd be Doctor Herbert Halsey, an undead who works in the Apothecarium of the Undercity.

[npctext 5515]
text0_0=Have a look at my meats, friend.  You won't want to go out into the Barrens without a good stock of provisions.

[npctext 5516]
text0_0=You haven't lived until you've looked down on the world from the back of a wind rider.

[npctext 5517]
text0_0=You can find passage to Theramore from this dock.  Heed my words, those lands are rarely safe to travel for people of the Alliance.  Watch your step and your back.

[npctext 5519]
text0_0=Good day to you.

[npctext 5520]
text0_0=You are beyond my level of expertise. George Bolero, the master of Duncan's Textiles around the corner could help you advance your skills.

[npctext 5522]
text0_0=Speak with Lawrence Shneider at Duncan's Textiles around the corner to the left. He is adept at dealing with beginners.

[npctext 5523]
text0_0=A fine display of worthiness. Your instruction may now continue.

[npctext 5524]
text0_0=Ah, this Darnassian fabric is the finest!

[npctext 5525]
text0_0=Well, aren't you the smarty-pants? Ye know more than I do, I can tell ye that! Don't go getting' a big head, but if ye want to keep learnin', have a chat with Georgio Bolero in Stormwind. They say he knows his tailorin'!

[npctext 5527]
text0_0=I don't have time to babysit! Go talk to me assistant, Uthrar!

[npctext 5528]
text0_0=Hmm... you show a little promise, I'll give you that. Okay then, where were we?

[npctext 5529]
text0_1=Do you hear the call of the hunt, $c?  You must listen closely, but the call comes from deep within you.  It comes from deep within all of us.
unk0_1=6

[npctext 5530]
text0_0=I made a lot of the things you see in the store. What do you think? Answer carefully, your life may depend on it.

[npctext 5531]
text0_0=You need to learn from someone who knows more than I do. Go talk to Josef Gregorian in Undercity. Well, what are you still doing here?

[npctext 5533]
text0_0=What? Why are you bothering me? Why, I bet you can't even create a high quality robe! Go talk to Snang and come back when you're worthy of my talents!

[npctext 5534]
text0_0=About time you showed me some results! Now I'll show you results!

[npctext 5535]
text0_0=They say a stitch in time saves... what, eleven? Ah, I can't remember. Stupid saying anyway.

[npctext 5536]
text0_0=Not bad... for an amateur! Still, you know about as much as I do. If you wanna' learn more you're gonna' have to talk to Josef Gregorian in Undercity.

[npctext 5539]
text0_0=Well well, not too bad. Maybe I CAN show you a few things...

[npctext 5540]
text0_1=What a fine day! It inspires me to create a new design.

[npctext 5541]
text0_1=Your talents excel! You are truly inspired. To continue your pursuit of knowledge, speak with Georgio Bolero in Stormwind. He is held in high regard, and will be able to further your instruction.

[npctext 5543]
text0_1=There are basics that must be learned. Trianna is standing nearby, speak with her and return to me later.

[npctext 5544]
text0_1=You have done well, traveler. I am proud to call you my student!

[npctext 5545]
text0_1=Welcome to our tent. May I assist you?

[npctext 5546]
text0_1=Your knowledge is great, traveler. You must learn from one who is wiser than I. Many tales have been told of the wisdom of Josef Gregorian. You may find him in Undercity.

[npctext 5549]
text0_1=Expertly accomplished! Now, let us continue your education...

[npctext 5551]
text0_1=Aren't the patterns beautiful? Each one speaks with its own voice.

[npctext 5552]
text0_1=My knowledge is limited, though I am still learning. It is time for you to move on, traveler. Find Josef Gregorian in Undercity and tell him you are ready.

[npctext 5554]
text0_1=There are fundamental things you must learn before I can aid you. Speak to my apprentice, Vhan. He is kind and patient and will teach you what you need to know.

[npctext 5555]
text0_1=You are truly a determined student. I will be happy to provide you with instruction!

[npctext 5556]
text0_1=Tailoring can come in very handy. I once had to sew my arm back on.

[npctext 5557]
text0_1=You have worked your way up??? time to see the boss. Go to Josef and tell him you are ready.

[npctext 5559]
text0_1=How can I share my secrets with a beginner? Try speaking with Victor Ward first.

[npctext 5560]
text0_1=Good, you've got some grit! I like that. Well then, let's get going!

[npctext 5561]
text0_0=Yes, I've been running this shop for some time now. Business has been pretty good lately. A lot of new adventurers coming through...

[npctext 5562]
text0_0=There's only one person I know of who is more learned in the art of tailoring than myself. Last I heard he could be found in Theramore Isle. He is the person you should seek.

[npctext 5564]
text0_0=You'll need more training before I can share my knowledge with you, I'm afraid.

[npctext 5565]
text0_0=Good! I can tell that my efforts will not be wasted!

[npctext 5566]
text0_0=Cloth is okay. Personally I prefer to work with human skin.

[npctext 5567]
text0_0=You require the instruction of a true master! Go to Daryl Stack in Tarren Mill and embrace your destiny!

[npctext 5569]
text0_0=I will instruct you when the time is right... that time is not now. You have much more to learn first!

[npctext 5570]
text0_0=Good! I can tell that my efforts will not be wasted!

[npctext 5571]
text0_0=I have outfitted kings. With the proper training, you can too.

[npctext 5573]
text0_0=You have come a long way, traveler. There is one more task for you to perform...

[npctext 5574]
text0_0=I cannot help you until you have learned more of the essentials. Come back to me when you are ready.

[npctext 5575]
text0_0=The place is a bit drafty... but what do I care? I'm dead.

[npctext 5577]
text0_0=You're doing very well in the art of tailoring, I must admit. Now, let's see how good you REALLY are...

[npctext 5578]
text0_0=Who sent you here? You're not ready for my instruction yet! You'll be told when you're ready.

[npctext 5579]
text0_1=I do so enjoy sitting out here, listening to the sounds of the Great Sea.  Oh, what?  Yes, there is a ship that will take you to Menethil Harbor.  It docks here from time to time.

[npctext 5580]
text0_0=Mark my words!  You won't find faster gryphons anywhere in the Eastern Kingdoms than the ones right here in Thelsamar!

[npctext 5581]
text0_0=If you ask me, there's no greater profession than a miner.  And if you ask me, there's no greater miner than a dwarf!

[npctext 5582]
text0_0=The Wildhammer dwarves might have fast steeds, but can those Aerie Peak gryphons stand the heat of The Great Forge?  I think not!

[npctext 5583]
text0_0=The best miner has a firm grip on $ghis:her; pick, a stout heart in $ghis:her; chest, and thick, black dust in $ghis:her; hair.

[npctext 5584]

[npctext 5593]
text0_1=This bear wanders a path close to where the Talondeep Path lies, due west of Mystral Lake and the Alliance outpost of Silverwind Refuge.  While he is the easiest of the three creatures you will face on the Ashenvale Hunt, he should not be trifled with.  His presence is a constant threat to travelers who sojourn between Ashenvale and the Stonetalon Mountains.

I wish you luck in the hunt for this creature!

text0_0=Through rigorous retraining I have had to break many students of all they had previously learned so that I might teach them anew.  The service I offer becomes increasingly difficult to perform each time it is done.  It is for that reason that it becomes increasingly expensive with each retraining.  Do you desire that I break you of the talents you have learned?

[npctext 5674]
text0_0=If you desire, in addition to training, I have it within my power to erase the knowledge of your talents from your mind.  Be warned that every time you undergo this procedure the more difficult it is to perform, and therefore the more expensive it becomes.

He was the creator of his own end. The sadness it brings me has never lessened, even as time passes...

text0_1=The Shen'dralar were Queen Azshara's most revered arcanists. It was within these very walls that the Queen's most important demands were processed - often in secret.$B$BAfter the destruction of the Well and the subsequent lethargy that overcame the Highborne and lesser night elf sects, the Prince of Eldre'Thalas, Tortheldrin, began construction of the pylons that you see littering the halls of the west wing.

[npctext 6899]
text0_1=The Prince plotted to imprison a demon of immense power behind a grand force field. The pylons would channel latent energies into the field, keeping it operational.$B$BWhile imprisoned, Immol'thar would serve as a battery to the populace of Eldre'Thalas.

[npctext 6900]
text0_1=The siphoned energies would sustain the Highborne's magic, allowing those within the walls of Eldre'Thalas to feed their endless and growing magical pangs.$B$BThousands of years passed and the power required to keep Immol'thar imprisoned while sustaining life within Eldre'Thalas, began to shift. The cost to keep Immol'thar bound grew to overshadow the rate at which energy could be siphoned and distributed. The once net gain turned to loss.

[npctext 6902]
text0_1=The people were destroyed in order to preserve the Prince's immortal life and near limitless powers. The power once divided among thousands now funnels into the Prince and the Shen'dralar zealots. Those few remaining survivors are directly feeding power into the pylons in order to keep Immol'thar imprisoned.$B$BShould the demon break free of its bonds, it would surely destroy what little is left of this once great bastion of arcana.

All of Eldre'Thalas flourished from its existence.

It is being corrupted by the demonic lord of that section of Eldre'Thalas, Alzzin the Wildshaper.

This cult, known as the Burning Blade, threatens the very sovereignty of Durotar. Many believe that the orc Warchief Thrall is aware of the Blade's existence and has chosen not to destroy it in the hopes that its members might lead him straight to the Shadow Council.

[npctext 7181]
text0_0=A stack of papers and schematics are strewn here.

[npctext 7182]
text0_0=These papers are guarded.  Speak with Zamek to create a distraction!

[npctext 7183]
text0_0=Recently, a night elf druid named Naralex discovered a network of underground caverns within the heart of the Barrens. Believing he could use the caverns' springs to restore lushness to the Barrens, the druid began siphoning the energies of the fabled Emerald Dream. His vision somehow became a nightmare, however, and soon the Wailing Caverns changed into a den of vicious, deadly predators. It is said that Naralex still resides somewhere inside the labyrinth, trapped beyond the edges of the Emerald Dream.

[npctext 7185]
text0_0=Frustrated by the Dalaran wizards' lack of progress against the undead during the Third War, the Archmage Arugal elected to summon the extra-dimensional worgen to bolster his side's diminishing ranks. The wolf-men slaughtered the Scourge, then quickly turned on the wizards themselves and laid siege to the keep of the noble, Baron Silverlaine. The fort quickly fell into shadow and ruin. Driven mad with guilt, Arugal adopted the worgen as his children and retreated to the newly dubbed 'Shadowfang Keep'.

[npctext 7187]
text0_0=Once the greatest gold production center in the human lands, the Dead Mines are now inhabited by the Defias Brotherhood, who have turned the dark tunnels into their private sanctum. It is rumored that the thieves have conscripted the clever goblins to help them build something terrible at the bottom of the mines - but what that may be is still uncertain. Rumor has it that the way into the Deadmines lies through the quiet, unassuming village of Moonbrook.

text0_0=Shadowfang Keep is in southern Silverpine just north of Pyrewood Village.

[npctext 7200]
text0_0=Blackfathom Deeps can be found at the north end of Zoram Strand along the coast of Ashenvale.

[npctext 7201]
text0_0=Situated along the Zoram Strand of Ashenvale, Blackfathom Deeps was once a glorious temple dedicated to the night elves' moon-goddess Elune. However, the great Sundering shattered the temple - sinking it beneath the waves of the Veiled Sea. There it remained untouched - until, drawn by its ancient power - the naga and satyr emerged to plumb its secrets. Legends hold that the ancient beast, Aku'mai, has taken up residence within the temple's ruins.

[npctext 7202]
text0_0=Gnomeregan can be found in western Dun Morogh.

[npctext 7203]
text0_0=Located in Dun Morogh, Gnomeregan has been the gnomes' capital city for generations, though it was recently infested by mutant troggs. In a desperate attempt to retaliate, High Tinker Mekkatorque ordered the emergency venting of the city's radioactive waste tanks. Though the troggs became irradiated, their siege continued unabated and the gnomes were forced to seek refuge in the dwarven city of Ironforge, where the High Tinker now enlists brave souls to help his people reclaim their beloved city.

[npctext 7204]
text0_0=Razorfen Kraul can be found on the very southern tip of the Barrens on the west side of the road.

[npctext 7205]
text0_0=During the War of the Ancients, the demigod Agamaggan came forth to battle the Burning Legion. The colossal boar was defeated, and over time in the areas where his blood fell, massive thorn-ridden vines sprouted to life. The quilboar came to occupy these regions and hold them sacred. The heart of these massive thorn-colonies is the Razorfen. Razorfen Kraul was conquered by the crone, Charlga Razorflank, who some speculate has been negotiating with agents of the Scourge for some insidious purpose.

[npctext 7206]
text0_0=Scarlet Monastery lies in the hills northeast of Tirisfal Glades.

[npctext 7207]
text0_0=The monastery was once a center for learning and enlightenment. With the rise of the undead Scourge during the Third War, the peaceful Monastery was converted into a stronghold of the fanatical Scarlet Crusade. The Crusaders are intolerant of all non-human races, regardless of alliance or affiliation. They believe that any and all outsiders are potential carriers of the undead plague - and must be destroyed.

[npctext 7208]
text0_0=Razorfen Downs can be found on the very southern tip of the Barrens on the east side of the road.

[npctext 7209]
text0_0=Crafted from the same vines as Razorfen Kraul, Razorfen Downs is the traditional capital city of the quilboar race. The sprawling, thorn-ridden labyrinth houses a veritable army of loyal quilboar as well as their high priests - the Death's Head tribe. Recently, however, a looming shadow has fallen over the crude den. Agents of the undead Scourge - led by the lich, Amnennar the Coldbringer - have taken control over the quilboar race and turned the maze of thorns into a bastion of undead might.

[npctext 7210]

[npctext 7212]
text0_0=Uldaman is an ancient Titan vault that has laid buried within the earth since the world's creation. Dwarven excavations of the city have recently released the Titans' first failed creations: the troggs. Legends say that when the Titans deemed the trogg experiment a failure they tried again, resulting in the creation of the dwarven race. These secrets are recorded on the fabled Discs of Norgannon - massive artifacts that lie at the bottom of the ancient city, protected by giant constructs of living stone.

[npctext 7213]
text0_0=The ruins of Zul'Farrak are located in the northwestern corner of the Tanaris Desert.

[npctext 7214]
text0_0=This sun-blasted city is home to the Sandfury trolls, known for their particular ruthlessness and dark mysticism. Troll legends tell of a powerful sword called Sul'thraze the Lasher, a weapon capable of instilling fear and weakness in even the most formidable of foes. Long ago, the weapon was split in half. However, rumors have circulated that the two halves may be found somewhere within Zul'Farrak's walls.

[npctext 7215]
text0_0=Maraudon is located in the middle of the western coast of Desolace, in the Valley of Spears.

[npctext 7216]
text0_0=Maraudon is one of the most sacred sites within Desolace. The great temple/cavern is the burial place of Zaetar, one of two immortal sons born to the demigod, Cenarius. Legend holds that Zaetar and the earth elemental princess, Theradras, sired the misbegotten centaur race. It is said that upon their emergence, the barbaric centaur turned on their father and killed him. Some believe that Theradras, in her grief, trapped Zaetar's spirit within the winding cavern - used its energies for some malign purpose.

[npctext 7217]
text0_0=The Sunken Temple can be found in the center of a great lake in eastern Swamp of Sorrows.

[npctext 7218]
text0_0=Blackrock Mountain lies between Searing Gorge in the north and Burning Steppes in the south.

[npctext 7219]
text0_0=Once the capital city of the Dark Iron dwarves, this volcanic labyrinth now serves as the seat of power for Ragnaros the Firelord. Ragnaros has uncovered the secret to creating life from stone and plans to build an army of unstoppable golems to aid him in conquering the whole of Blackrock Mountain. Obsessed with defeating Nefarian and his draconic minions, Ragnaros will go to any extreme to achieve final victory.

[npctext 7221]
text0_0=The ruins of Dire Maul stand in central Ferelas.

[npctext 7223]
text0_0=The School for Necromancy known as Scholomance is on the ruined island of Caer Darrow in the Western Plaguelands.

[npctext 7225]
text0_0=The ruined city of Stratholme lies in the Eastern Plaguelands to the north of the Plaguewood.

[npctext 7226]
text0_0=Once the jewel of northern Lordaeron, the city of Stratholme is where Prince Arthas turned against his mentor, Uther Lightbringer, and slaughtered hundreds of his own subjects who were believed to have contracted the plague of undeath. Arthas' surrender to the Lich King soon followed. The broken city is now inhabited by the undead Scourge - led by the powerful lich, Kel'Thuzad, and a contingent of Scarlet Crusaders, led by Grand Crusader Dathrohan. The two sides are locked in constant, violent combat.

[npctext 7227]
text0_0=The Deadmines can be found beneath Moonbrook in the south of Westfall.

[npctext 7229]
text0_0=The Stormwind Stockades are found near the mage quarter in Stormwind.

[npctext 7230]
text0_0=The Stockades are a high-security prison complex, hidden beneath the canal district of Stormwind city. Presided over by Warden Thelwater, the Stockades are home to petty crooks, political insurgents, murderers and a score of the most dangerous criminals in the land. Recently, a prisoner-led revolt has resulted in a state of pandemonium within the Stockades - where the guards have been driven out and the convicts roam free.

text0_0=Well done, citizen. Those kobolds are thieves and cowards, but in large numbers they pose a threat to us. And the humans of Stormwind do not need another threat.$b$bFor defeating them, you have my gratitude.

[npctext 31006]
text0_0=Yes? Yes? What is it?$b$bFor a race of people who don't need to breathe underwater, they certainly do have huge appetites. Make yourself at home... make yourself at home. My name's Renee if you need anything at all.

[npctext 31007]
text0_0=Oh? A letter? Wonderful news! I've been waiting on word from my dear old mother in Deathknell. Such a saint, she is. I wonder how she's holding up.$b$bWhat? Too cheery? Not buying it, are you?$b$bWell, get lost then... it's really no business who the letter's from anyway. Go on! Get lost!$b$bCome back when you've got some coin to spend... loafer.$b$bNext thing you know, you'll be coming back to rest after a long days adventure or some stupid thing like that.

[npctext 31008]
text0_0=Good work, friend. You have earned your pay well. Who knows, perhaps Westfall will prosper once again.

[npctext 31009]
text0_0=Well, what news do you have? You look like you've been in quite the fight... is Scrimshank alive?

[npctext 31010]
text0_0=He was a good goblin, young Scrimshank. Let's hope that his demise was not in vain by what he was able to record with his surveying equipment.$b$bIt seems as though we have quite the situation on our hands here with these bugs. They're way too cunning for their own good, and the research we've done so far is shaping up to indicate that they might even be under the controlling influence of a third party! If this is the case, then it bodes ill for not only Gadgetzan, but the whole desert!

[npctext 31011]
text0_0=Hail, $N. Have you been killing Gnolls...?

[npctext 31012]
text0_0=I see you've been busy! You have our thanks, $N.

[npctext 31013]
text0_0=We have not time to talk, $N. The Defias Pillagers are denying the people of Westfall the peace and prosperity they deserve. Make sure at least 15 Defias Pillagers and 15 Defias Looters have been killed. That will send a clear message that corruption is not welcome here.

[npctext 31014]
text0_0=Your worth to The People's Militia has been validated by your brave acts thus far.

[npctext 31015]
text0_0=$N, now is no time for idle chatter. If you still wish to prove yourself to The People's Militia you need to slay the Defias I notified you about earlier. Return to me when you have completed your duty.

[npctext 31016]
text0_0=When I left the tainted lands of Lordaeron I returned to a grim state of affairs here in my homeland. But there is hope for Westfall yet. As proven by your valor in battle, it is obvious to me that you serve our cause with honor. It is with great pride that I induct thee into The People's Militia. May the Light shine upon you.

[npctext 31017]
text0_0=I don't like hearing of all these kobolds in our mine. No good can come of this. Here, take this as payment, and when you're ready, speak to me again. I would like you to go back to the mines one more time...

[npctext 31018]
text0_0=Have you been slaying orcs, $N? If so, then show me...

[npctext 31019]
text0_0=That makes for a lot fewer orcs to worry about, thanks.

[npctext 31020]
text0_0=Ah - $N - I was just thinking about you! How goes your hunting?

[npctext 31021]
text0_0=Ah, the paw of Ursangous! Your skill is impressive, $C; he is credited with numerous kills. The crescent on his paw is no doubt a sign that he was trained by the night elves that skulk about Ashenvale. Ursangous is... was one of the mightiest bears you'd find in these parts. To have bested such a creature is a testament to your will and resolve.$b$bYour ancestors would be proud!

[npctext 31022]
text0_0=Greetings once again, $N! Have you come to show me proof of your hunt?

[npctext 31023]
text0_0=A victory for $N in the Ashenvale Hunt! Well done - the head of Shadumbra is a fitting trophy to claim for such an impressive fight, no doubt.$b$bShadumbra's savagery was well known throughout the post here. Any trip to the west, especially on foot trying to get out to the Zoram Strand, was wrought with danger because of this tiger. Thanks to you, this danger has abated.

[npctext 31024]
text0_0=Yeah, I heard that someone tore up the lake out there like a dust devil through the Barrens. From the sound of it too, we might be able to set up a possible observation area out there to keep an eye on our Alliance friends. Well, that is if we can keep it on the down low...$b$bLooks like you ended up being quite useful after all; the transports between here and Stonetalon should have an easier time of it. Take this - you've earned it.

[npctext 31025]
text0_0=Salutations, young $C; the time has come for you to know our aquatic form. It is one that lets you move freely and indefinitely through water. You will find this aspect a useful tool and a blessing... but it is one that must be earned before it is mastered.$b$bYou will face two trials to overcome. The first will test your ability to work in water under pressure. The second will test your resolve to understand the aspects of the form itself.$b$bStand ready, as the time of testing is now upon us.

[npctext 31026]

[npctext 31027]
text0_0=Well now it looks like yet another druid has successfully completed the Trial of the Lake! Well done, my young friend, well done!$b$bAs Ive said, my name is Tajarri. It is my duty and my privilege to serve as a warden for Moonglade, and especially this shrine. Keeper Remulos guides the Cenarion Circle in preservation of nature and balance, $b$band his shrine serves as a lasting tribute to such. By using the bauble here, it serves as a nod to the importance of this place within the Circle.

[npctext 31029]
text0_0=Have you formed your pendant for me to inspect, Furrburger? If you need help in locating the parts, try asking the local populace for information. Not only will you find what you seek, but it will give you a reason to explore this wondrous and sacred glade.

[npctext 31030]
text0_0=You've completed the Trial of the Sea Lion, Furrburger - congratulations.$b$bEach task in acquiring the pendant shows that both agility and endurance are necessary to act in harmony with what you desire to do underwater. Neither can exist without the other, and both cannot be done without you willingness to embrace the aspect of the sea lion.$b$bRemember these lessons well, and count on them once you have gained your aquatic form.

[npctext 31031]
text0_0=I'm sorry, I don't know you... but from the look of things you have at least heard something of me. Now, what can I help you with? Do you have something for me?

[npctext 31032]
text0_0=This report... I've dealt with these beasts before. Fizzledowser was wise to send this, and you, to me.$b$bThese creatures will consume the Tanaris desert rapidly; they are nothing short of one of the greatest menaces we all will ever face. Familiarize yourself with this name, $N: silithid. The insects mentioned here are the silithid, and they are the tools of one of the greatest threats that both the Horde and Alliance face.$b$bIf only we were smart enough to see that before.

[npctext 31033]
text0_0=Hey $N. I'm getting hungry...did you get that tough wolf meat?

[npctext 31034]
text0_0=You've been busy! I can't wait to cook up that wolf meat

[npctext 31035]
text0_0=Is Bellygrub still at it or were you able to rid Lakeshire of the pest once and for all?

[npctext 31036]
text0_0=Finally the menace is laid to rest! Thank you, $N, you have done me a great service. The garden shall be in full bloom this season!

[npctext 31037]
text0_0=Yes, murlocs have settled in and around the streams of eastern Elwynn. We don't know why they are here, but they are aggressive and at least semi-intelligent.

[npctext 31038]
text0_0=I'm going to miss that Verna Furlbrow so much. I don't suppose you happened to see her on your way here?

[npctext 31039]
text0_0=That Verna was always such a sweet lass. We'll miss her here in Westfall but between you and me, she's a city girl at heart and Stormwind will suit her just fine. But enough gossip! Now we can make Westfall Stew!

[npctext 31040]
text0_0=Although much has been stripped from the corpse, strewn nearby is a medallion with the words: "Footman Malakai Stone" etched upon it.

[npctext 31041]
text0_0=Come back with the following ingredients: $b $b 3 Stringy Vulture Meat $b 3 Goretusk Snouts $b 3 Murloc Eyes $b 3 Okra

[npctext 31042]
text0_0=That Okra will thicken up this broth nicely! Now we just add the Stringy Vulture Meat, a few Murloc Eyes and those delicious Goretusk Snouts. And we're done! For all your help, $N, I want you to take today's first batch of Westfall Stew!

[npctext 31043]
text0_0=Hmm, this news is troubling. Already our defenses are stretched thin, and losing Rolf and Malakai to those murlocs put us in an even worse position.$b$bIf things don't improve, there will be fighting in Goldshire by the week's end!

[npctext 31044]
text0_0=Yes, I spoke with Remy. I respect him as a merchant, though all reports of Murlocs to the east have been sketchy at best.$b$bYour concerns are noted, but unless I receive a military report of a murloc threat, we can't afford to send more troops east.

[npctext 31045]
text0_0=You find around the neck of the corpse a metal medallion inscribed with the words "Footman Rolf Hartford."

[npctext 31046]
text0_0=How goes the hunting, $N?

[npctext 31047]
text0_0=You have the fins? Great! Marshal Dughan is anxious about the Murloc situation in eastern Elwynn, and I'd like to tell him that it's becoming under control.$b$bYour actions have helped realize that.

[npctext 31048]
text0_0=Psst! You have that Gold Dust for me...for me?

[npctext 31049]
text0_0=Thanks for the dust, $N. Here's your cash, and...here is a token from associates of mine. You might find it useful...useful.

[npctext 31050]
text0_0=Thanks a lot for the help, $N. Something in the forest must be making these animals so bold.$b$bWhatever it is, I hope it stays there.

[npctext 31051]
text0_0=You have word from McBride? Northshire is a garden compared to Elwynn Forest, but I wonder what Marshal McBride has to report.$b$bHere, let me have his papers...

[npctext 31052]
text0_0=Well, it says here that you've been awarded Acting Deputy Status with the Stormwind Marshals. Congratulations.$b$bAnd good luck - keeping Elwynn safe is no picnic... what with most the army busy doing who knows what for who knows which noble!$b$bIt's hard to keep track of politics in these dark days...

[npctext 31053]
text0_0=Is Morbent Fel defeated?!

[npctext 31054]
text0_0=Morbent Fel has been defeated. The dark riders are still at large, but a small piece of that which I had hoped beyond hope has come to pass.$b$bYou have done the impossible, and your deeds will forever live in the legends of Duskwood.$b$bGo, $N. And perhaps, one day, fate may bring you back to me...

[npctext 31055]
text0_0=Splendid, Albert. For your service to the people of Darkshire you shall be rewarded.

[npctext 31056]
text0_0=The people of Darkshire thank you, $N. You have proven yourself to be a great ally of The Night Watch.

[npctext 31057]
text0_0=On behalf of the people of Darkshire and as the Leader of the Night Watch, I thank you, $N, for your bravery and dedication. May the Light shine upon your ways.

[npctext 31058]
text0_0=I have been commissioned by the Stormwind Army to supply their people with cloth and leather armor.$b$bIf you have a marker for me, then I'd be happy to make you something.

[npctext 31059]
text0_0=Ah, thank you for the marker. Please feel free to pick your choice of armor.$b$bLuck to you, brave $C. And may this armor serve you well.

[npctext 31060]
text0_0=Did you gather those candles yet?

[npctext 31061]
text0_0=You were busy hunting kobolds, were you? Thanks for the candles, $N, and here's your reward...

[npctext 31062]
text0_0=Oh, a shipment from my brother? Splendid! Fortune truly shines on me today!

[npctext 31063]
text0_0=Here is your payment ... and while you're here, take a look around! I'm sure we have a potion or other trinket you'd find useful.

[npctext 31064]
text0_0=What do you have to report, $N? Have you been to the Fargodeep Mine?

[npctext 31065]
text0_0=This is bad news. What's next, dragons?!? We'll have to increase our patrols near that mine. Thanks for your efforts, $N. And hold a moment... I might have another task for you.

[npctext 31066]
text0_0=Don't suppose you were able to get my watch?

[npctext 31067]
text0_0=My watch! Thank you so much, kind sir! $b$bWe are but poor farmers and we have lost our land but please accept this reward as a token of our appreciation.

[npctext 31068]
text0_0=So, Stoutmantle sent you? Well, I owe him.

[npctext 31069]
text0_0=What have ya got there? Let me take a look at that. . .

[npctext 31070]
text0_0=You've got some nerve bringing this here.

[npctext 31071]
text0_0=Hello, $N. Have you discovered the fates of Rolf and Malakai?

[npctext 31072]
text0_0=You have confirmed my fears, $N. The murlocs are a threat we cannot ignore.

[npctext 31073]
text0_0=You slowly slide the lid of the crate off. . . .

[npctext 31074]
text0_0=Kobolds at the Jasperlode Mine, you say? Curses! The situation is worsening by the minute!$b$bThank you for the report, $N. But I wish that the news you brought was good news.

[npctext 31075]
text0_0=I trust that your arrival here at our camp is to deliver the bottles of ripple that are integral to the task at hand, yes?

[npctext 31076]
text0_0=Finely executed, $N. I am glad you had enough foresight not to bruise the delicacy of the ripple. There is nothing worse than the bouquet of ripple that has been jostled about needlessly.$b$bIt will take a moment for the magic to be wrought over this precious cargo. Actually, no magic is involved; I merely have some empty packaging for Hinterlands Honey Ripple. Our chicanery shall turn these bottles into an alcoholic treasure of the ages.$b$bOnward - for great booze!

[npctext 31077]
text0_0=Back again, Galinassa? What do you have this time?

[npctext 31078]
text0_0=Why yes! The writing on this page does in fact match that of the registry signatures.

[npctext 31079]
text0_0=If you're not here to buy anything, and you're not here to deliver anything, then you're wasting my time! You better have that ripple!

[npctext 31080]
text0_0=Well, let's see what's in this barrel!$b$bYes, yes, it looks as though it is all here. Here's your fee for the package, good job on that. I stand to make five times that fee when I sell it to the tavern! Har har!$b$bThese extra bottles of Hinterlands Honey Ripple are going to be set for a special occasion. I think I'll drink some with champagne. I'll call it... champipple.

[npctext 31081]
text0_0=You're Junior Surveyor $N, yes? Quickly now, there is a dire situation at hand! Do you have the insect parts that Fizzledowser said you would?!

[npctext 31082]
text0_0=Good work - I'll start my analysis on these now! I can tell you right from the start though... these are nothing like any insect form I have ever seen. It's almost as if these bugs are being controlled by an outside force or something.$b$bYou need to go talk to Fizzledowser right away; apparently there is an emergency that he needs your help with on the double! I'm not sure, but I think it involves more of the bugs in the Tanaris desert!

[npctext 31083]
text0_0=I'm running low on linen, $N. Do you have any for me?

[npctext 31084]
text0_0=Ah, these are nice bandanas, if a little rough...$b$bHere you are!

[npctext 31085]
text0_0=Ugh... I'm starving! Do you have that pie for me, $N?

[npctext 31086]
text0_0=Mm, yum! This pie is the best!$b$bI think my memory is coming back to me...

[npctext 31087]
text0_0=You lost a what? Well I didn't take no necklace, because I ain't no thief!$b$bI might know who did but...<grin>...I'm too hungry to remember.

[npctext 31088]
text0_0=I don't think it's right feeding the boy who stole my necklace in the first place, but if that's what it takes to get back what's mine, then so be it!$b$bDo you have that boar meat?

[npctext 31089]
text0_0=Though this wild boar meat is tough, simmer it enough and it sure does make for some tasty pie!

[npctext 31090]
text0_0=Hello, $N. Have you found my necklace?

[npctext 31091]
text0_0=Oh, you found it! Thank you, thank you dear!$b$bHere, take this. It was my husband's and he always said it was lucky. If only he didn't forget it on his last campaign! *sniff

[npctext 31092]
text0_0=Did you see her yet? Did you get her?

[npctext 31093]
text0_0=Thank goodness! That pig was getting so big she'd have eaten our whole crop! Thank you, $N.$b$bNow, do either of these suit you?

[npctext 31094]
text0_0=A mound of dirt is here, hastily piled up as if someone had need of hiding something...without much time to do it.

[npctext 31095]
text0_0=I knew it! Fine work, Galinassa.

[npctext 31096]
text0_0=Have you secured the Pyrewood Shackles yet, $N?

[npctext 31097]
text0_0=Your persistence is commendable. With the knowledge you helped me gather, Arugal will fall and his reckless magic shall be undone. Cheers to you, $N.

[npctext 31098]
text0_0=Bring to me 10 ghoul fangs, 10 skeleton fingers and 5 vials of spider venom. For you I shall enchant a Totem of Infliction which will harm those who attempt violent acts against you.

[npctext 31099]
text0_0=Very wise of you, $N. This Totem of Infliction will help to protect you against the evil which lurks throughout Azeroth and beyond. When you feel threatened, hold this totem and take comfort in its magical aura. Be brave, fair $C. You will need all the courage you can muster for I see much bloodshed in your future.

[npctext 31100]
text0_0=Have you collected 8 paws from those treacherous Gnolls yet?

[npctext 31101]
text0_0=Well done, $N. With valiant adventurers such as yourself fighting alongside The People's Militia, Westfall just might return to the prosperous breadbasket it once was. Please accept this in recognition of your tireless efforts.

[npctext 31102]
text0_0=You have what?? Maybell is the light of my dull life. Hurry, let me see her letter!

[npctext 31103]
text0_0=Ah! I can't stand us being apart. I have to see her!!

[npctext 31104]
text0_0=You have a note from "Gramma" Stonefield, eh? I haven't seen Mildred in years! I wonder what she has to say...

[npctext 31105]
text0_0=My heart goes out to those two poor souls, Maybell and Tommy Joe. I remember being young and in love, once.$b$bThere must be something I can do to help them! Let me think...

[npctext 31106]
text0_0=Ah, so my friend sent you here? How kind. $b$bWell the Stormwind Monarchy has abandoned our cause. Now it is up to the People's Militia to keep the land free from corruption. If our cause interests you, I can put your combat skills to use in the name of freedom.

[npctext 31107]
text0_0=Yes, I have the results right here. They are... unsettling, to say the least$b$bOur initial suspicion that the bugs are being controlled by an outside force, we believe, is correct. If this is the case, then we are dealing with not only a very powerful unknown force, but also a malignant one. These bugs have been changed to be pure ravagers. I've never seen anything quite like it.

[npctext 31108]
text0_0=While our families are feuding, Tommy Joe and Maybell don't have much of a future, but... maybe we can get them together for just a little while.$b$bHm, what can we do...

[npctext 31109]
text0_0=Do you have that crystal kelp? I'm sure Maybell is anxious to see her beau...

[npctext 31110]
text0_0=You got them. Good show! Now, just one moment while I concoct the potion...

[npctext 31111]
text0_0=Well Junior Surveyor $N, has ol' Pestlezugg got that report ready yet?

[npctext 31112]
text0_0=Thank you for delivering the report, Junior Surveyor $N; here is your pay for your diligent service to the Gadgetzan Water Company.$b$bWhile I am usually not thrilled about handing out our valuable information carte blanche to those who would otherwise pay good coin for it, I've known Pestlezugg for a number of years now. If he recommends letting everyone know about it, then so be it. Give me a moment and I'll make you a copy.

[npctext 31113]
text0_0=Did you deliver my letter to Tommy Joe? What did he say??

[npctext 31114]
text0_0=Oh...my! I feel guilty deceiving my family, but my feelings for Tommy Joe are too strong to ignore.$b$bThank you, $N. I'll drink this liquor as soon as I have the chance and sneak away to my love.$b$bAnd for you... please take this.

[npctext 31115]
text0_0=How goes your conflict with the shadowcasters? Did you find the midnight orbs?

[npctext 31116]
text0_0=Thank you, $N. I'll send these to be destroyed immediately.

[npctext 31117]
text0_0=I need you to pick up a keg of Thunderbrew Lager from Grimbooze Thunderbrew in the Westfall hills, a cask of Merlot from Stormwind, a bottle of Moonshine from Darkshire and a skin of Sweet Rum from Goldshire. Bring those back to me and I will see to it you are rewarded.

[npctext 31118]
text0_0=A job well done, $N! I know well the roads you had to journey to procure this fine array of liquor. But my patrons will be happy once again! $b$bMy wife is quite a seamstress. Please accept this cloak she made in return for your services.

[npctext 31119]
text0_0=Hurry, my friend, move with haste $bIn order for our rich lager to taste $bMore like beer and less like stew, $bHops are needed to make the brew.

[npctext 31120]
text0_0=Hops and Barley, yeast and malt $bThe taste-buds feel a virtual assault, $bNo need to plead, no need to beg $bFor Thunderbrew Lager comes in a keg!

[npctext 31121]
text0_0=What's that? Verner sent you, you say? Well give me his note. And SPEAK UP!

[npctext 31122]
text0_0=Heh, so old Verner needs some shoes, does he!?!

[npctext 31123]
text0_0=Great, you're back! Did you get the shoes?

[npctext 31124]
text0_0=Thank you, this really helps me out.$b$bBut what's this? Argus sent a note with the crate...What?? Argus wants me to PAY him? Bah!$b$bWell, $N, thank you for your help.

[npctext 31125]
text0_0=What have you there?

[npctext 31126]
text0_0=At ease, $C.$b$bMagistrate Solomon is a noble leader. His words carry great weight with me. I shall seek the counsel of the King and make the situation clear to him. Assure the good judge that he has the Stormwind Army's support. Reinforcements will be sent as soon as word is given from His Majesty.

[npctext 31127]
text0_0=Did the General send news? Are reinforcements on the way?

[npctext 31128]
text0_0=Thank you for your time, $C. For your service to Lakeshire and Stormwind I reward you with these coins.$b$bNow if you'll excuse me, I find this correspondence somewhat of a mystery. Something is amiss in our Kingdom. I fear this is the beginning of conflict, not the end.

[npctext 31129]
text0_0=I know that greedy Argus will send someone to collect his scales if I don't give them to him soon. Have you found those scales yet?

[npctext 31130]
text0_0=Thanks! These will get me out of debt to Argus...

[npctext 31131]
text0_0=Thank you for all your help, $N.

[npctext 31132]
text0_0=Yowler is a dangerous creature, $N. If you're not ready for him, I understand.

[npctext 31133]
text0_0=Again, thank you for your help. The Stormwind army is so busy dealing with the orcs, they don't have the troops to protect Redridge from local threats like the gnolls.

[npctext 31134]
text0_0=You have some sunfish for me, eh?

[npctext 31135]
text0_0=Pleasure doin' business with you, matey!

[npctext 31136]
text0_0=I see you have fought valiantly against the Blackrock Clan, $C. Your service to our township is great indeed.

[npctext 31137]
text0_0=Darcy sent me a lunch, did she? Such a kind heart she has. Well...let's have it!

[npctext 31138]
text0_0=Thanks, I could really use the meal. Guarding Lakeshire from the orcs and gnolls is tough work!

[npctext 31139]
text0_0=You need a bouquet of flowers? You haven't been in town very long...have you already found for yourself a sweetheart here?$b$bI know I shouldn't pry, but it's nice to see that love is in the air... especially in dangerous times like these.

[npctext 31140]
text0_0=Hello again, $N. Did Parker like the lunch I sent him?

[npctext 31141]
text0_0=Oh, those are lovely! I can't wait to put them in some water!$b$bBut...these are Martie's favorite flowers. Parker didn't have you go to that jealous vixen for this bouquet, did he? You didn't tell her who they were for, did you? If you did, then it wouldn't surprise me if she poisoned them.$b$bOh, but it's not your fault. Thank you, and here's your meal.

[npctext 31142]
text0_0=Good to see you back, $N. What did Wiley have to say for himself?

[npctext 31143]
text0_0=Bah! I should have let that scoundrel rot when I had the chance. But this information is crucial. Good work.

[npctext 31144]
text0_0=I think I hear a pack of Ghouls scurrying around the back of the house - I better put that effigy up quick! Did you get those Ghoul Ribs for me?

[npctext 31145]
text0_0=Ah, thanks. These will do just the trick!

[npctext 31146]
text0_0=What business do you have with me? I am a very busy man. . .

[npctext 31147]
text0_0=This matter might be more complex than Stoutmantle realizes.

[npctext 31148]
text0_0=Did Master Shaw shed any light on things?

[npctext 31149]
text0_0=Edwin VanCleef. . .I know the name well. To think that a man so industrious and talented could turn into such a scoundrel unnerves me. I'll need further proof before I believe this.

[npctext 31150]
text0_0=$N, were you able to gather any information? Did you locate the messenger?

[npctext 31151]
text0_0=This is indeed firm proof that VanCleef is in charge. Now all we need to know is where the Defias gang is hiding out.$b$bWe've had a stroke of luck while you were gone. We captured a thief trying to steal Saldean's wagon. He has promised to lead us to the hideout in exchange for his life. I want you to defend the traitor so he can reveal the hideout. Return to me once you have uncovered the location.

[npctext 31152]
text0_0=Hail, $C. What business do you have with The People's Militia?

[npctext 31153]
text0_0=Good Messenger, you have served your master well.

[npctext 31154]
text0_0=Shall we expect the People's Militia soon? Does Lord Stoutmantle's news bode well?

[npctext 31155]
text0_0=I do say, this is not good at all. I did not realize that Stoutmantle's situation was not unlike ours here in Lakeshire. What action is so important that it calls the Stormwind Army away from its people? Bah, I should not ponder aloud.$b$bHere, messenger. Accept these coins in exchange for your service to the Township. I might call upon you again.

[npctext 31156]
text0_0=You appear to have traveled from afar, $C. What business do you have here in Darkshire?

[npctext 31157]
text0_0=Thank you for making the long journey here. This is indeed important information.

[npctext 31158]
text0_0=Ah, good to see you back, messenger. Shall I inform the Marshal that the Night Watch is on its way from Darkshire?

[npctext 31159]
text0_0=By the Light! The Stormwind Army retreated from Westfall. And the Guard no longer protects Darkshire? There is some treachery abound. How could this be so? $b$bOh I forgot to reward your service, $C. Here are some coins. Now excuse me. Something is amiss in Stormwind and I must get to the bottom of it.

[npctext 31160]
text0_0=Do you have those fins? Hurry, we need those murlocs driven from the lake!

[npctext 31161]
text0_0=Well done, Albert. I hope you didn't have too much trouble with those murlocs.$b$bIt's strange seeing them so far from the sea. I wonder if they're here because they're running from something...

[npctext 31162]
text0_0=Old Blanchy is on her last leg. Did you happen to find any oats for her?

[npctext 31163]
text0_0=Thank you so much, $N! Poor Old Blanchy will be so happy!

[npctext 31164]
text0_0=Bring me 15 red leather bandanas and I'll pay you well.

[npctext 31165]
text0_0=Nice work, $R. Please accept one of these items as payment for all your hard work.

[npctext 31166]
text0_0=I need to string the Ghost Hair Thread along my door and my windows to keep out unwanted spirits. Did you get it for me?

[npctext 31167]
text0_0=Delightful! This will do splendidly...$b$bHere, good $N, take this as payment for your honorable deed.

[npctext 31168]
text0_0=I need that Zombie Juice to keep me warm on these cold, dark nights. Did you get it for me?

[npctext 31169]
text0_0=A thousand thanks, Galinassa. You warm an old man's heart with your foolish-...I mean...with your kindness!$b$bHere you are, friend. Take this as a token of my gratitude.

[npctext 31170]
text0_0=You say somethin', sonny? Can't hear a bloody thing besides the ringin' in me ears. Say, what's that you got there?

[npctext 31171]
text0_0=Ah, well Ol' Hinderweir is wise to be worried.

[npctext 31172]
text0_0=Peace and tranquility be on to you, stranger. Why have you sought me out this day?

[npctext 31173]
text0_0=This report... we night elves know of the terror mentioned here. Fizzledowser was wise to send this, and you, to me.$b$bThese creatures will consume the Tanaris desert rapidly; they are nothing short of one of the greatest menaces we all will ever face. Familiarize yourself with this name, $N: silithid. The insects mentioned here are the silithid, and they are the tools of one of the greatest threats that both the Horde and Alliance face.$b$bIf only we were smart enough to see that before.

[npctext 31174]
text0_0=No! Please don't kill me! It's just me... Jitters!! They're everywhere... I can't escape them! Monsters in Raven Hill? N-n-n-o... couldn't be. Only harmless Jitters.

[npctext 31175]
text0_0=Did you find any sign of my brother? Is there any hope after all this time?

[npctext 31176]
text0_0=My suspicions were correct. My poor brother.... Well, thank you for bringing some conclusion to this mystery, even if the conclusion was grim.

[npctext 31177]
text0_0=Were you able to retrieve any of my old co-worker's Miners' Union Cards?

[npctext 31178]
text0_0=Thank you for collecting these, $N. Your efforts will help bring peace to the dead in the wake of this tragedy. I will see to it that the families are notified.

[npctext 31179]
text0_0=If the problems we've had here are indicative of what is happening elsewhere in our lands, by Magni's beard, we have some troubles ahead of us! I can only hope that the king and Senate are taking steps to deal with the threat the troggs pose.

[npctext 31180]
text0_0=It is a pleasure to see you again, $N. Have you attended to the duties you've volunteered for during Children's Week?

[npctext 31181]
text0_0=May the heavens bless you, $N. You've done more for Randis than most would ever think of doing for him. Thank you - you're a shining star in the skies of the Alliance.$b$bPlease - if you can spare the time, come back and visit us. I know that Randis would like that, as would I.

[npctext 31182]
text0_0=Zug zug! My name is Grunth, and I guess you're looking after me? You're an adventurer, like my mom and dad were. My matron says that they died with honor in battle. I'm happy to meet you.$b$bI hope we'll do plenty of things together. I have some things I'd like to do, and the matron says you'll be like a big brother to me during this week. I'd like that a whole bunch.

[npctext 31183]
text0_0=Impressive, $N. It would seem that you are capable enough to handle yourself. Perhaps a more suitable challenge could be found for one of your abilities.$b$bIt is curious though... The worgen seemed to just appear out of thin air. But then, with all the other strange creatures that have moved across our borders, I suppose it's only one of many concerns.

[npctext 31184]
text0_0=Have you found a skilled engineer to create a bronze tube yet?

[npctext 31185]
text0_0=This is perfect, $N. The first step is complete!

[npctext 31186]
text0_0=Why yes, I used to own a looking glass.

[npctext 31187]
text0_0=I showed Cog the beginnings of our star-viewing machine. He was impressed. Did you happen to find a reflective device?

[npctext 31188]
text0_0=Most superb! This will work perfectly. Many thanks!

[npctext 31189]
text0_0=Wolves giving you a bit of trouble? You'd do well to avoid the fangs and claws and other sharp bits, yes?

[npctext 31190]
text0_0=Ah! Wonderful. The wolf meat should do nicely. Oh, don't worry, $N, I wouldn't forget my part of the bargain. Here, one of these should fit you.

[npctext 31191]
text0_0=Argh! Those Light-blasted trolls!$b<He takes a few breaths and seems to settle down... a bit.>$bA group of them came in the night and stole my journal! I knew better than to trust that good-for-nothing appr...

[npctext 31192]
text0_0=Excellent! I can go back to my... leisurely... hunting now. Thank you, $N.

[npctext 31193]
text0_0=You have the deed to my farm?? That's good news! Some ruffians stole it days ago... I thought it was gone for good!$b$bPlease, let me have it. We're on our way out of Westfall and ain't coming back any time soon, but if we do then we'll need those papers...

[npctext 31194]
text0_0=Loads of thanks, $N! As I was saying, these parts aren't fit for honest folk anymore, but if things get better, then this deed will let us reclaim our land.$b$bI don't have much to offer you, but here -- take this.

[npctext 31195]
text0_0=Nicely done, $N. You are ready to move on.

[npctext 31196]
text0_0=I am impressed, $C. You are progressing quite well.

[npctext 31197]
text0_0=Most impressive. I believe you are almost ready.

[npctext 31198]
text0_0=How goes the hunt for Sin'Dall?

[npctext 31199]
text0_0=Most impressive, I do say! You are a true Master Tiger $C, $N!

[npctext 31200]
text0_0=You've had success I hope? All over the place, those trolls. Filthy devils.$b$bOh yes, that reminds me! Be sure to tell your friends, yes? We could use much assistance!

[npctext 31201]
text0_0=Oh excellent, excellent. That'll help a little, for the present...$b$b<He trails off, grumbling about profit margins and costs...>$b$bWhat? You're still here? Reward? Oh, right... of course, here, take this... it should be more than enough.

[npctext 31202]
text0_0=Bhag'thera can prove to be an elusive beast. How fairs the hunt?

[npctext 31203]
text0_0=Off to a good start, $N!

[npctext 31204]
text0_0=Bhag'thera can prove to be an elusive beast. How fairs the hunt?

[npctext 31205]
text0_0=Off to a good start, $N!

[npctext 31206]
text0_0=Bhag'thera can prove to be an elusive beast. How fairs the hunt?

[npctext 31207]
text0_0=Off to a good start, $N!

[npctext 31208]
text0_0=Bhag'thera can prove to be an elusive beast. How fairs the hunt?

[npctext 31209]
text0_0=Off to a good start, $N!

[npctext 31210]
text0_0=Nicely done, old chap!

[npctext 31211]
text0_0=Now that's how you get a trophy or two over the ol' hearth! Nice killing, $N!

[npctext 31212]
text0_0=Ho ho!! We have ourselves a true raptor slayer! Nicely done, old chap!

[npctext 31213]
text0_0=How goes the hunt for Tethis? Tracked her all the way back to camp, did you?

[npctext 31214]
text0_0=Master $N, the raptor slayer!$b$bHas a nice ring to it, eh?

[npctext 31215]
text0_0=Yes? What do you want? Oh, supplies from the goblins. Strange seeing a $R delivering them, usually they send their own. No matter... you didn't touch them did you? Good good... we wouldn't want anything to happen to our mines, oh no.

[npctext 31216]
text0_0=These land mines will help us defend ourselves from that animal Kurzen and his men. Thank you for bringing them. If you need further work, I can probably find something for you to do. And you won't have to deal with those goblins, hm?

[npctext 31217]
text0_0=Did you happen to discover any clues, $N?

[npctext 31218]
text0_0=This is an alarming discovery, to say the least!

[npctext 31219]
text0_0=These are Bookie Herod's notes and records.$b$bAmong them are: a list of supplies within the camp, material requests from Colonel Kurzen, and various letters and correspondences.

[npctext 31220]
text0_0=Well? Did you have any luck in locating the camp?

[npctext 31221]
text0_0=Hmmm, so my information was correct, as usual. Interesting. Well, I don't suppose they pose any sort of threat of interference with our operation, but perhaps they have a need for some of our excellent manufactured products. Hmmm...

[npctext 31222]
text0_0=Well done. The loss of those Jungle Fighters will relieve some of the pressure on our camp.$b$bBut now that you've had a taste of the forces we're up against, do you still want to throw your lot in with us??

[npctext 31223]
text0_0=I'm waiting on those remedies and that extract, $N.

[npctext 31224]
text0_0=Well done, $N. These remedies will keep more of us alive and in fighting shape. And the extracts will help us create our own remedies.

[npctext 31225]
text0_0=Do you have those fetishes, Pluto? They might hold the secret to Kurzen's degradation...I must k

[npctext 31226]
text0_0=I see you're back, old bloke. King Bangalash has caused me to come crawling back to camp many times. Hang in there.

[npctext 31227]
text0_0=Bloody well done! Right-o! Congratulations, $N, for succeeding where others have failed.$b$bI am honored to count you as a comrade of our great hunting party here. No one will ever doubt your expertise in hunting and tracking!$b$bCheers to you, I say! Cheers!

[npctext 31228]
text0_0=Tough buggers, aren't they? Well, have you had any luck? Sorry to seem impatient, but this has been a huge thorn in my side! Well?

[npctext 31229]
text0_0=Ah, good work, good work! Ugh, though you could have done a better job cleaning off the-- Well, no matter, no matter! My thanks to you, $N, our operation will no doubt see increased output and productivity thanks to your help! Good good, now, onto other matters...

[npctext 31230]
text0_0=Hello! You brought me something?

[npctext 31231]
text0_0=Oh I see, it's a Krazek's Crock Pot! An ingenious piece of work, but it can break a spring or throw a gear now and then. Let me see what's wrong with this one...$b$bAha! Its steam charger is rusted out, it has a cracked knuckle-gasket and its fobulator is missing teeth. I'm surprised the pot could even boil a turnip in this state!$b$bCan I fix it? Of course I can fix it!$b$bBut there's a price. Oh yes, there is always a price...

[npctext 31232]
text0_0=$N! Do you have that haunch? I must begin preparing it soon, or the banquet will be ruined!

[npctext 31233]
text0_0=Ah, this will do nicely! Many, many thanks!$b$bNow if you'll excuse me, I must get the haunch chopped, marinated and garnished for the banquet.

[npctext 31234]
text0_0=I need those stones, $N. By whatever means necessary! Just do it, don't give me the details!$b$bIt's about results, $N, nothing more, nothing less.

[npctext 31235]
text0_0=Fascinating. That the crystals have been tumbled using this process can only indicate that they are planning to use them as some sort of fuel or other catalyst. I don't know much more than that. Samples will have to be dispatched to Head Chemist Gigglefont.

[npctext 31236]
text0_0=Yes, what Thorsen told you is true. You must be discrete with this. At one time, we rebels were fiercely loyal to Colonel Kurzen. But such was Kurzen's corruption, our passion twisted into rage.  If it was made known that Private Thorsen has had recent dealings with Kurzen's men, then one night he would find himself with a slit throat.$b$bTo my knowledge, only Sergeant Yohwa, Thorsen and I were privy to Thorsen's mission. But there must be another. A traitor.

[npctext 31237]
text0_0=Well done $C, well done! I will continue to send forces to thin out the furbolg, but I can at least count on a different path that will be free of Alliance entanglements. The Horde conquest of Ashenvale is now in full swing!$b$bYou've earned your pay this day, hero. I salute you!

[npctext 31238]
text0_0=Most excellent, $N! You have brought hope to Loch Modan. With Grawmug dead, we stand a better chance of seeing the Troggs eliminated from the land.

[npctext 31239]
text0_0=Smishir! Any luck?

[npctext 31240]
text0_0=Wonderful, Smishir! Many thanks for retrieving my notebook. Well, it would seem that the troll situation here in Coldridge Valley is under control and not much cause for worry.$b$bAfter I put the finishing touches on my report, I'll need someone to courier it to my brother Senir.

[npctext 31241]
text0_0=You performed well against the Dark Runners, $N. But it seems as though their numbers are inexhaustible. Every time we make progress, more spring up to refill their ranks.$b$bWhat is the evil power that draws them here? Why have they come to disturb our unhappy realm...$b$bI will put my faith in Master Carevin. No doubt he will get to the bottom of the problem.

[npctext 31242]
text0_0=$N, to be honest with you, I did not believe that you would get this far, but you are clearly a $C to be reckoned with. In fact, if you wish to formally join Master Carevin's struggle, I will gladly write for you a letter of recommendation.

[npctext 31243]
text0_0=Yes, what is it? Make it quick, I've pressing matters to attend to.

[npctext 31244]
text0_0=Excuse me for my cold reception, $N, but as I'm sure you can tell, I am an extremely busy man. I see that you have impressed Calor--and I assure you, that is no small feat--and that he has given his recommendation.$b$bThere are unsavory types afoot, $N, and we can use the help of all who have proven themselves. We battle against demons, the undead, and those who would provide them aid. Be vigilant, be wary, and trust none who would not give aid to our cause.$b$bGlory under the Light.

[npctext 31245]
text0_0=Well done, $N! You demonstrated uncanny courage on the battlefield. Our war against the Troggs will be won with efforts such as yours. You have served King Magni well.$b$bIf you fancy yourself well-suited for this kind of adventuring, I suggest you speak with Mountaineer Gravelgaw. The Captain has him assigned to a rough patrol that I am sure he can use some help with. Check with Gravelgaw just inside the tower.

[npctext 31246]
text0_0=Morgan Ladimore?$b$bAhh, yes, of course. His was a long and sorrowful tale. I knew him, well, before he left for the war, but that was the last time I saw him. A noble and good man, he was, but he suffered a bad end.$b$bHere, I should have something here that can tell the tale better than my own recollections...

[npctext 31247]
text0_0=Morgan Ladimore? Never heard of...$b$bOh, you mean Mor'Ladim! I guess you haven't heard the story?$b$bWell, I'll give you the short version. A wandering undead calling itself Mor'Ladim has been wandering Duskwood. From what we've gathered, it appears to be the undead body of Morgan Ladimore, of whom you apparently know. He's been causing us all sorts of problems, attacking Watchmen on patrol and killing people.$b$b<She sizes you up.>$b$bYou seem to be capable enough, maybe you could lay him to rest.

[npctext 31248]
text0_0=I don't blame you if you're having trouble with him, $N. Some of our strongest Watchers have been lost to Mor'Ladim.

[npctext 31249]
text0_0=Yes, and what may I assist you with? Are you here on business for the Royal Apothecary Society, or have you arrived here merely to brighten my day?

[npctext 31250]
text0_0=Ah, Zinge needs a kit, does she? It saddens me that Zinge does not choose to grace myself with her sweet presence.$b$bVery well, let me procure a kit for you.

[npctext 31251]
text0_0=Yes? Do you have something for me?

[npctext 31252]
text0_0=Thank you, I've been waiting for these letters for quite some time...$b$bUnfortunately, these letters aren't all for me. This one is addressed to Grelin Whitebeard. He's not too far away if you'd like to deliver it to him.

[npctext 31253]
text0_0=Is there something I can help you with?

[npctext 31254]
text0_0=Ahh, excellent. It's been a while since I received word from Ironforge.

[npctext 31255]
text0_0=You accomplished your mission well, $R. The King himself would be proud.$b$bThe reinforcements promised to us never showed, however. Apparently the Alliance front is a sea of crimson from the blood of our fallen brethren. The news of the losses leaves a bitter taste in one's mouth. But we must not let their deaths go for naught. We must rally in these grim times and bring glory back to the Alliance.$b$bSpeak with Mountaineer Wallbang for reassignment. You're needed now more than ever.

[npctext 31256]
text0_0=Yes, I think Luca is as disturbing as you do. It matters not - hand me the field sampling kit. I will need to make some adjustments to it in order to survey for the proper base materials.$b$bYou have the kit, don't you?

[npctext 31257]
text0_0=Good - it pleases me to be working with someone who takes pride in not wasting my time.$b$bAfter I make some adjustments to this kit, you'll be ready to head out into the field. You'll be using it to collect some vital data to the task at hand.$b$bIt will take just a moment for me to finish the modifications. While you are waiting, you should probably start thinking about what you'd like to bring to the desert with you.$b$bYes, I said the desert.

[npctext 31258]
text0_0=Marshall Dughan sent you, eh? Well you're not from the army, but if Dughan sent you then that's good enough for me!$b$bOur situation is, to say the least, a stressed one. I hope you can give us a hand.

[npctext 31259]
text0_0=Ah, our model 4711-FTZ power sources! We normally use them to power the water wells, but THANKS TO THE VILE NOMADS, we have an over abundance of power sources right now.$b$bSure, I can get you a power source for whatever nefarious science experiment you think you're trying to hide from me. It ain't gonna be free though, $R. Nothing's free in Gadgetzan.

[npctext 31260]
text0_0=There are Redridge gnolls that close to Elwynn?? They may be poised to advance into our homeland. Soon the people of Lakeshire may not be the only humans under siege!$b$bHere is your pay, though you bring us dire news. And it comes at a bad time, for we are ill equipped to deal with it.

[npctext 31261]
text0_0=<Deputy Feldon listens to your report...>$b$bThere's a sizable force of gnolls encamped there, and from what you tell me they are tough ones. It must not have been easy for you to gather this intelligence.$b$bHere you are, $N. We are grateful for your aid.$b$bAnd if you haven't already done so, speak with Marshal Marris and Magistrate Solomon within Lakeshire. Our situation grows ever more desperate - those two will have need of you I'm sure.

[npctext 31262]
text0_0=The suspicious looking barrel contains a strange smelling powder.

[npctext 31263]
text0_0=Ah, is the note translated? Please, let me see it...

[npctext 31264]
text0_0=<Ello reads the letter...and his face goes white. He then looks at you...>$b$bAlthough the aid you gave Abercrombie may have been motivated from kindness, your actions have doomed our town.$b$b<Ello becomes lost in his thoughts...>

[npctext 31265]
text0_0=Have you had any luck?

[npctext 31266]
text0_0=Ah, this is excellent news! Your efforts are greatly appreciated by myself and the people of Thelsamar. Better yet, if we can solve the ogre problem, we'll be able to shift our focus to those Light-burning troggs.

[npctext 31267]
text0_0=Yes? Is there something I can do for you?

[npctext 31268]
text0_0=Yech! What is that thing? And why would you bring it...$b$bBloody--! Is it? Well, Light burn me, is that the head of that bloody ogre? This certainly is a catch then! Here, your reward and the thanks of myself and the people of Thelsamar.

[npctext 31269]
text0_0=If you have something that belongs to the shadowy figure for whom you seek, then let me see it. I may be able to divine something of its owner.

[npctext 31270]
text0_0=Hmm... Someone handled this book recently, someone who is driven by revenge. But the impressions left on it, at least the impressions from the original owner, are faint.$b$bI can tell, however, that the original owner of this book is not a native of Darkshire.

[npctext 31271]
text0_0=I knew the second I laid eyes on you, $N, that you would make Ironforge proud. You have served King Magni well. Now that you've proven yourself to be such a loyal aid to the Kingdom, perhaps you should talk with the Captain to see if he'll entrust you with a higher detail.$b$bI salute you, $N.

[npctext 31272]
text0_0=The stone is cold to the touch, but has obviously been abused. Trash litters the area; nicks and gashes decorate the relief atop the coffin; and the foliage around the grave has started to grow over the site.$b$bNo one cares for whoever is buried here, especially not any victims of the plague.

[npctext 31273]
text0_0=You place the worthless pendant on the grave, and the gemstone within the setting seems to dull noticeably.$b$bAs you stand to leave, you look down at the pendant; it lies lifelessly over the hands of the relief sculpted into the top of the coffin. Your thoughts are interrupted by a stiff, cool breeze passing over the Sepulcher. For a moment everything around you is silent.

[npctext 31274]
text0_0=Do you have 8 Trogg Stone Teeth to show me? If not, there is still work to be done, $N.

[npctext 31275]
text0_0=I am quite impressed, $N. You have done the Dwarven race a great favor by defending our lands. King Magni Bronzebeard himself would be proud!

text0_0=Lightforge Iron is a precious metal, but it sounds like your quest is a dire one. You've come a long way, Brother. With luck, you might just find what you seek!$b$bAnd if you do get the iron, I know who can fashion it into a weapon against this Necromancer you speak of in Duskwood.

[npctext 31277]
text0_0=Have you formed your pendant for me to inspect, Furrburger? If you need help in locating the parts, try asking the local populace for information. Not only will you find what you seek, but it will give you a reason to explore this wondrous and sacred glade.

[npctext 31278]
text0_0=You've completed the Trial of the Sea Lion, Furrburger - congratulations.$b$bEach task in acquiring the pendant shows that both agility and endurance are necessary to act in harmony with what you desire to do underwater. Neither can exist without the other, and both cannot be done without you willingness to embrace the aspect of the sea lion.$b$bRemember these lessons well, and count on them once you have gained your aquatic form.

[npctext 31279]
text0_0=Hmph, it'll take more than a Dark Iron ambush to stop the deliveries!$b$bBut Saean... I would never have suspected him to be one of their sympathizers. We've been working with him for almost a year now... maybe I missed the signs.$b$bWell, I'll consider that later.

[npctext 31280]
text0_0=What is that you bring from Ashlan?

[npctext 31281]
text0_0=A disarming colloid? For Seaforium? Oh heavens!

[npctext 31282]
text0_0=This land is soothed by your efforts, and for this I will grant you a boon.

[npctext 31283]
text0_0=Do you have the needed items? Time is of the essence!!

[npctext 31284]
text0_0=Just in time, $N!

[npctext 31285]
text0_0=Our merchants will not be safe until we are rid of Gobbler and those Murlocs.

[npctext 31286]
text0_0=Ah, well done $N.$b$bAccept this as payment for fulfillment of your contract with the Merchant Marines.

[npctext 31287]
text0_0=The top of the keg slowly twists off.

[npctext 31288]
text0_0=The keg fizzles slightly as the Disarming Mixture settles in.

[npctext 31289]
text0_0=This crate is covered with clawed scratches, and the marks of water damage. Prying it open reveals soggy and rotted straw, as if something of value was stored in the crate. You search through the straw...$b$b...and find a an armload of red-colored bottles.

[npctext 31290]
text0_0=Hail! Have a care, Smishir, the tunnel to Dun Morogh is infested with troggs and is not safe for travel.$b$bIf you haven't any pressing business in Dun Morogh, I'll have to ask you to remain in Anvilmar until the tunnel is safer.

[npctext 31291]
text0_0=Hm, well, if Whitebeard is sending you to Dun Morogh on important business, I can't very well stop you, can I?$b$bAt least let me provide you with some advice and directions.

[npctext 31292]
text0_0=Thank you so much, $N!! You have saved the Stonewrought Dam! Without your help, the Dark Iron terrorists would have surely seen to this mighty landmark's demise. You have made the Kingdom and the Alliance proud, brave $C.$b$bThe Dam is once again safe. . . for the time being at least. . . .

[npctext 31293]
text0_0=This barrel is largely untouched. Prying it open...$b$b...you are assaulted by the pungent odor of cheese. It's a little wet, but still tasty!

[npctext 31294]
text0_0=This barrel is halfway buried amidst the mud and grass ...

[npctext 31295]
text0_0=Do you have the statuette?

[npctext 31296]
text0_0=The captain of the Blind Princess will be relieved to hear this precious cargo has been recovered. You have well earned this payment for services rendered.$b$bIt is good to see dependable folk like you, especially in trying times such as these.

[npctext 31297]
text0_0=You can't find it? My directions were very clear! We don't have much time, you've got to hurry! Don't come back until you've found the cave.

[npctext 31298]
text0_0=Ah, $N! I didn't think you'd have much trouble finding the place, my directions are excellent, you know...$b$bLet me just finish up my report then.$b$b<He brings out some paper and scribbles on it momentarily.>$b$bThere! Well, haha, now this certainly is funny... I don't suppose, $N, that you would mind doing one last favor for me?

[npctext 31299]
text0_0=Oh, I'm so very thirsty! Won't you buy a drink for this poor, pathetic fool?

[npctext 31300]
text0_0=Ah! That hits the spot, and loosens the tongue. Thanks, mate!

[npctext 31301]
text0_0=In my dreams, I can sometimes hear the doomed moans of my brethren! Please, good sir, free them from the bonds and quiet their cries.

[npctext 31302]
text0_0=My thanks to you, $N. And the gratitude of my cursed brethren goes to you as well.

[npctext 31303]
text0_0=Hmm... it would seem that my guards are becoming less discriminatory with petitioners. Well, what do you want? Make it quick.

[npctext 31304]
text0_0=<He quickly peruses the report.>$b$bAuthority of the KING!? Has Magni taken complete leave of his senses! And that damnable Whitebeard... Taken matters into his own hands, has he? The Senate will not be pleased to hear about this, not one bit.$b$bWhat, are you still here? Go, before I call the guards!

[npctext 31305]
text0_0=What is that orb you have? It looks...soiled.

[npctext 31306]
text0_0=An Eye of Paleth. But this one has seen much sorrow...it must have been witness to a terrible, terrible tragedy.$b$bLet me cleanse it, for the Eyes were created to shine bright, and their powers can be quite dangerous if tainted like this one.

[npctext 31307]
text0_0=Killing is a dirty business, but you did your job well, $N. If I weren't obligated to stay with the Prospector and Merrin, I'd be down there shedding blood right along side you.

[npctext 31308]
text0_0=You did a bang-up job of clearing out those Raptors, $N!

[npctext 31309]
text0_0=Is Sarltooth dead? Have you redeemed the memory of the fallen?

[npctext 31310]
text0_0=Thank you, $N. Your efforts here will not be forgotten. Many innocent Dwarves died at this site, simply doing their jobs. The vengeance you delivered to those evil creatures should make them think twice before attacking King Magni's subjects ever again.

[npctext 31311]
text0_0=Do you have those Idols? We must study them and report our findings to Ironforge!

[npctext 31312]
text0_0=You got them! Nicely done, $N!$b$bAnd you don't look too worse for wear, even with those berserk Troggs about. I'm going to keep my eye on you...you show some promise.

[npctext 31313]
text0_0=Oh, a progress report from the site? Very good!

[npctext 31314]
text0_0=Bah! Ironband's having trouble with the Troggs. I wonder if he wants that blastpowder to aid his digging, or to aid his efforts against the Trogg beasts...$b$bWell, either way it's powder well spent!$b$bBut what's strange is, I sent him plenty of blastpowder weeks ago. I wonder where it went...

[npctext 31315]
text0_0=Have you uncovered the four fragments yet, $N?  Ados, Modr, Golm and Neru...

[npctext 31316]
text0_0=Ah the Goaz Stone is complete! Fine work, $N. Fine work indeed. Now I can continue with the delicate translation of this Titan script. I can make out new words already! Hmm. . .it says here, "Old Gods. . .Chained Beneath the Land." This is the beginning of something epic.

[npctext 31317]
text0_0=We Stormpikes don't like being bothered with trivial matters, $C. I hope you brought news worthy of my valuable attention.

[npctext 31318]
text0_0=Curse that Ironband! I sent him a load of blastpowder weeks ago, but he's made no mention of it in this report.$b$bSo...where did the blastpowder go?!?

[npctext 31319]
text0_0=What? Stormpike wants you to personally see the shipment to Ironband?$b$bI... suppose that's fine, the only problem is, I've already sent Huldar with the porters, Miran and Saean. You just missed them, they left just a short while ago.

[npctext 31320]
text0_0=Oh, thank the heavens you are here!

[npctext 31321]
text0_0=Were you able to find Merrin? Did she send word?

[npctext 31322]
text0_0=Such horrible news! At least 3 of them survived. But when will the killing end? I long for the day when King Magni's subjects can live without fear.

[npctext 31323]
text0_0=Do you have that Miners' Gear, $N?

[npctext 31324]
text0_0=Did you see a lot of Kobolds in there? I can't wait for the order to clear them out of the mine. The thought of their grimy hands clawing around our mine makes my stomach rumble!

[npctext 31325]
text0_0=Oh, thank the Light the powder is here. But it is troubling news that you bring as well. To think that the Dark Irons have sympathizers able to procure this sort of material for their dastardly plans.$b$bThat's a matter for someone else to consider, some other time. I must put this powder to good use.

[npctext 31326]
text0_0=The date on this barrel shows that it'll soon be tapped.

[npctext 31327]
text0_0=You quickly place Marleth's barrel of Barleybrew Scalder among the Thunderbrew barrels.

[npctext 31328]
text0_0=Did you make the switch?

[npctext 31329]
text0_0=Not bad, $N! Did you have a hard time getting past their guard?$b$bNo matter - many thanks, and if you're ever in need of stout with a kick, don't forget the Barleybrews!

[npctext 31330]
text0_0=Were you able to get into my meat locker, $N?

[npctext 31331]
text0_0=What a kind soul you are, $N! Thanks to your bravery I won't find myself starving when the cold season flurries blow in.

[npctext 31332]
text0_0=Hey, $N. Been to the Grizzled Den yet? Those Wendigos can be fierce.

[npctext 31333]
text0_0=Ah yes, these manes will work great! You show a lot of grit, $C - I wager we'll see great things from you.

[npctext 31334]
text0_0=Vagash still terrorizes the herd! Please help us by killing the wretched beast.

[npctext 31335]
text0_0=Very well done! Veron will be so happy when he hears the good news. To kill Vagash is no easy task. I imagine one day you'll be fighting alongside King Magni's men on the Alliance Front.

[npctext 31336]
text0_0=Do you have that Shimmerweed? I almost have a batch of stout ready to brew, and I want to try throwing the weed in with this mixture.

[npctext 31337]
text0_0=Great! I can't wait to use these in some of my recipes. There's one in particular I think it'll work great in...

[npctext 31338]
text0_0=Preparations are going well. How goes your hunting?

[npctext 31339]
text0_0=By Magni's beard, you sure did a lot of hunting!! Thank you, $N.

[npctext 31340]
text0_0=Bellowfiz needs some of my Evershine? Hm...all right.

[npctext 31341]
text0_0=Thank you, $N. It'll be nice to work our crafts without hearing so many growls and snorts outside the village.

[npctext 31342]
text0_0=Did you get that Evershine?

[npctext 31343]
text0_0=Yes, this will do just fine. I think I'll open a bottle right now and have a taste...

[npctext 31344]
text0_0=This chest is waterlogged, and its siding broken. Many claw marks mar both the inside and outside of the chest...as if Murlocs have searched through it and stolen its treasure.$b$bBut tucked deep within the chest is a single Lightforge Ingot. Unfortunately, many more will be needed if enough metal to fashion a weapon is to be gained.

[npctext 31345]
text0_0=How might I ply my craft for you, $C?

[npctext 31346]
text0_0=That is quite a tale you have. And lightforge iron! Not for years have I worked with such a metal. It will be an honor to craft with it again. And you must return to me later with the story of your battle against the Necromancer.$b$bBut we get ahead of ourselves. First, your weapon against Morbent Fel...

[npctext 31347]
text0_0=Did you find the lightforge iron you need?

[npctext 31348]
text0_0=Ah, you found them! Now let's get this lightforge iron hammered into something useful, eh?

[npctext 31349]
text0_0=Hello, $N. You haven't been gone that long, but I see a fire in your eyes I did not see before.

[npctext 31350]
text0_0=Ah, this will be proof against the fiend Morbent Fel! Well done!$b$bYou are ready. Morbent Fel will fall.

[npctext 31351]
text0_0=Greetings and welcome, master. Have you yet tried one of our fine wines?

[npctext 31352]
text0_0=Ah, so you've seen Renato? Well here you are, sir. A bottle of our special pinot noir. You'll not find its equal in all of Azeroth!

[npctext 31353]
text0_0=Have you assembled the chapters yet, $N?

[npctext 31354]
text0_0=You've certainly saved me a heap of trouble, $N! I can't thank you enough. It shouldn't be long now until we see Master Nesingwary's book in libraries throughout the world!

[npctext 31355]
text0_0=I don't suppose you were able to track down pages 1, 4, 6 and 8? Those four are all we need to piece Chapter I back together.

[npctext 31356]
text0_0=At last! Chapter I is complete!

[npctext 31357]
text0_0=We still need pages 10, 11, 14 and 16 to complete Chapter II, $N.

[npctext 31358]
text0_0=Chapter II is finally complete! Well done!

[npctext 31359]
text0_0=Any luck with pages 18, 20, 21 or 24? Those are the only ones we need to piece together Chapter III.

[npctext 31360]
text0_0=Phew! Good work, $N. Chapter III is now back together in one piece!

[npctext 31361]
text0_0=We just need three pages to finish off Chapter IV, $N. Do you have pages 25, 26 or 27 yet?

[npctext 31362]
text0_0=Superb! We now have Chapter IV ready to go!

[npctext 31363]
text0_0=Metallurgy? Ah yes, we have many books on the subject, and are happy to aid Brother Kristoff with his speech! Now...which particular book was it the good brother needed?

[npctext 31364]
text0_0=Mr. Sheaf is wondering where his book is? Well this is a tad embarrassing. I have the book, but I'm still making my copy and I'm not quite ready to give the original up!

[npctext 31365]
text0_0=You need what?? Maybe you haven't noticed, but we're busy fortifying Lakeshire's defenses and repairing damage from recent orc attacks. If you need Rethban Iron Ore, you'll have to get it yourself!

[npctext 31366]
text0_0=Were you able to find the book?

[npctext 31367]
text0_0=That's the one! Thank you, Isamant. May the Light shine brightly upon both your body and spirit!

[npctext 31368]
text0_0=....mother?$b$b...so cold...$b$b...heading into the Twisting Nether...h-h-h-hold me mother....

[npctext 31369]
text0_0=...feel strength returning....$b$bWhere might be? Booty Bay? Oh my! I had the strangest dream...$b$b...the weakness has not completely left me....

[npctext 31370]
text0_0=You're kidding? Shaw wants my help again? Of all the nerve...$b$bThe Defias Brotherhood, you say? Well, you're certainly the bearer of wonderful news, aren't you? Next you're going to tell me that Deathwing is still alive and attacking the city.$b$bAll right, tell me everything from the beginning. And don't leave out something you think might not be important. I need to know it all.

[npctext 31371]
text0_0=You appear to have uncovered the wreckage of... a robotic chicken? The voice from within the egg crackles to life again:$b$b"Yes, excellent work! This is indeed my homing robot, though my sensors indicate that it needs a jump start before it can fly back to Booty Bay for repairs. Go ahead and place the beacon inside the rover. The beacon will take care of the rest!"

[npctext 31372]
text0_0=You place the egg... distress beacon... inside the chicken... homing robot.$b$bHums and whirs are heard from inside the robot as it struggles to stand up. After the robot comes to life, Oglethorpe's voice is heard once more, but now from inside the robot:$b$b"OOX-17/TN is working at least, but it needs major repairs! It is much too heavy for you to carry it... but I think I have an idea. Are you up for watching over it some more?"

[npctext 31373]
text0_0=You come all the way from Stormwind? I hear it's getting dicey down there in the human lands, with brigands and orcs running about. A perfect place for a $C to prove his worth!

[npctext 31374]
text0_0=Aha! So Grimand finally finished my axe! I can't wait to try it against some troggs and kobolds!$b$bMany thanks, $N. It was a long distance to travel for this delivery.  Here are some coins for your efforts.

[npctext 31375]
text0_0=Do you have the remains of the Agamands? Are those cursed beasts finally destroyed?

[npctext 31376]
text0_0=Revenge has a sweet taste, don't you think? When you destroyed the Agamands, did you catch any hint of free will within them? I hope so. I hope they knew fear before they were smashed into oblivion.$b$bIt is a foolish hope, I know. But it is a hope I foster nonetheless.

[npctext 31377]
text0_0=Coleman speaks well of you, $N, telling of your successful forays into the Agamand Mills.$b$bThe Forsaken have need of your talents once again...

[npctext 31378]
text0_0=Do you have a report of your patrol?

[npctext 31379]
text0_0=Very good. Your efforts do much to keep the Scourge at bay. A commendation will be sent to my superior, Executor Zygand.

[npctext 31380]
text0_0=$N, have you acquired the book?

[npctext 31381]
text0_0=Very good, $N. I will study this book and determine the identity of that lich. You have served your Queen well.$b$b<Bethor opens the book and stares intently at its glowing pages...>$b$bAstonishing! The book you retrieved belongs to no one other than Gunther Arcanus!$b$bGunther was a skilled Necromancer in life; he and I were friends and comrades-in-arms, before the Plague. And judging from his book he has grown even more powerful in death.$b$bHis skills would be a great boon to us.

[npctext 31382]
text0_0=Is your task complete? Have you destroyed those dog-things and drained them of their ichor?

[npctext 31383]
text0_0=Expertly done, $N. The Scourge are mistaken if they think they can use those corpses against us, and the fluid you gathered from the Rot Hide slaves will be studied by our Apothecaries. It may have secrets we can use against them.$b$bAs I said, well done. But our struggle continues, and the conflict will surely offer you more chances to prove your worth to the Forsaken.

[npctext 31384]
text0_0=Magistrate Sevren wants a report? Very well: the defenders at The Bulwark are holding the majority of the Scourge at bay, but some do slip through on occasion.$b$bWe have seen sporadic Scourge activity east of this station, with a concentration around the Balnir Farmstead.

[npctext 31385]
text0_0=It is troubling to hear of the Scourge slipping past the Bulwark. The Lich King and his minions are ceaseless in their assaults.$b$bBut we will not give in. He will not take us again!

[npctext 31386]
text0_0=Yes?

[npctext 31387]
text0_0=Oh...my poor Thurman! I begged him to leave Agamand Mills with me and my father, but his family loyalty was too strong! And I knew it! I just knew it that Brand meant him harm!! Oh, curse this Plague, and the Scourge!$b$b<Yvette's face then smoothes and grows cold.>$b$bBut regrets are for the weak. As a Forsaken, I have new goals and love is not one of them. I would thank you for delivering this letter, for I had wondered what happened to my past love.$b$bBut that life is over. Forever.

[npctext 31388]
text0_0=Did you find Devlin?

[npctext 31389]
text0_0=Thank you. Devlin's bones will rest nicely on my mantle.$b$bIf my cold heart can find warmth, it is in knowing that the Agamands are destroyed. They failed me and my family when the Plague came - now I swear I will smash their remains under my heel!

[npctext 31390]
text0_0=Another of the walking dead, hm? Must have been quite a shock, waking up in the crypt with only the cold and Mordo to greet you...$b$bI see the confusion on your face. Let me try to explain our... situation... to you.$b$bWe have been freed from the control of the Lich King by our new leader, Lady Sylvanas. The Dark Lady guides us in our war against the hated Scourge and the holdouts of humanity who dog our every step.

[npctext 31391]
text0_0=You will not go far in this new life if you are unable to kill even the weakest of zombies, $N. Do not return until you have success to report.

[npctext 31392]
text0_0=It is unfortunate that the Scourge cannot be brought into the fold, their large numbers would be useful in the battles ahead.$b$bBut they will not join us, so we have no choice but to destroy them.

[npctext 31393]
text0_0=Deathguard Simmer sent word that you were going to provide me with some much needed reagents. Were you able to gather 10 pumpkins yet, $N?

[npctext 31394]
text0_0=You have performed your bidding well, young $C. You are proving yourself to be quite an asset to The Dark Lady's army.

[npctext 31395]
text0_0=Your masters are fools to send you here, for I will never again be a Scourge slave!

[npctext 31396]
text0_0=My book?!? So you were the thief who stole it!$b$bBut...what is this new enchantment upon it...Bethor? He is in Lordaeron?$b$bIf he still exists, then perhaps he too escaped from the Lich King's grasp...

[npctext 31397]
text0_0=Young $C, you shouldn't be wasting your time here in Brill when your people need you fighting for their cause. Now, take up arms and travel to the southwest, to the ruined tower, and slay Captain Perrine along with 3 Scarlet Zealots and 3 Scarlet Missionaries. We shall herd the Scarlet Crusade like cattle to their demise.

[npctext 31398]
text0_0=Captain Perrine's death will undoubtedly please The Dark Lady. You have performed your duty well, $C.

[npctext 31399]
text0_0=I see you have returned but your task is not complete. Perhaps you are at ease with the mere humans interfering with The Dark Lady's plan? Or perhaps you can heed the call of duty and slay Captain Vachon and his band of Scarlet Friars!

[npctext 31400]
text0_0=Captain Vachon's death will slow down the Scarlet Crusade's advancement in Tirisfal quite a bit. But other threats loom.

[npctext 31401]
text0_0=You have done extremely well, $C. With ruthless fighters like you conquering in the name of The Forsaken our race is one step closer to defeating Arthas once and for all. I have a good feeling about you, comrade.

[npctext 31402]
text0_0=Yes? Is there something I can help you with?

[npctext 31403]
text0_0=Edwin VanCleef, you say? I would as much expect a letter from my dead grandmother... So you've killed him then? Pardon me in saying, but I'm somewhat surprised. He was a peerless fighter in his younger years. Let's see what he finds the need to write to me about after so many years.$b$b<Baros peruses the letter.>$b$bEdwin... I see the years haven't changed you a bit, an idealist as ever, and a romantic. He doesn't care who he hurts, $N. Revenge has consumed him. But then, I'm not sure I can blame him.

[npctext 31404]
text0_0=Have you collected 10 Scarlet Insignia Rings yet, $C?

[npctext 31405]
text0_0=Varimathras would be proud. You serve your leaders well, $C.

[npctext 31406]
text0_0=Do you have five Duskbat Pelts and some Coarse Thread yet, $N?

[npctext 31407]
text0_0=I appreciate your efforts, $N. May Slyvanas recognize your bravery one day. . . .

[npctext 31408]
text0_0=Do try your best to keep yourself unharmed until I get you some armor.

[npctext 31409]
text0_0=Thank you, $N. This armor should help you out.$b$bHopefully, it should do you more good than the last one to wear it...

[npctext 31410]
text0_0=So long as a molester of the dead like Dextren Ward is permitted to live, justice stands betrayed. Return to me once Lord Ebonlocke's sentence of death is carried out on that defiler, Ward. We shall give the families of the dead the closure they deserve and better yet, we will send a clear message to the House of Nobles in Stormwind.

[npctext 31411]
text0_0=So Dextren Ward finally paid for his crimes against humanity? Good riddance to the scum I say. And cheers to you, my friend! Not only have you given the families of the dead the peace of mind they deserve, you sent a poignant message to those corrupt bureaucrats in the House of Nobles. Stormwind must rise to the needs of the people of Duskwood or we will break free from their tyranny.

[npctext 31412]
text0_0=Hmm, well, it's a start. It'll take a few weeks or months to fully clean out the infestation. After that, we'll have to get down there with some torches to burn away the webbing.$b$bYou've done your duty well, $N, I'm sure I can find something else for you to do.

[npctext 31413]
text0_0=Those fools... They happily send themselves to their own graves.

[npctext 31414]
text0_0=If only they listened to reason, eh, $N? Perhaps we could sit them down for reasonable discourse... ha!$b$bLight-blinded fools.

[npctext 31415]
text0_0=How goes your mission, $N?

[npctext 31416]
text0_0=Hmm... Let's see what you've got...$b$b<He begins to rifle through the documents you recovered.>$b$bSome news of their exploits against us... Worthless. Scouting reports... New orders, "Continue to build up a camp near the ruined city..." Nothing we didn't know already... Ah, what's this? A map of the dispositions of some of their field commanders and agents! We can use this.

[npctext 31417]
text0_0=Yes, what do you want?

[npctext 31418]
text0_0=Yes, this is very good. You've done well in obtaining this information, $N. Hmm... names of the officers in the Tirisfal Glades...$b$bImagine the blow we could deal to the morale of those bloody zealots if we were to kill their leaders in one swift strike.

[npctext 31419]
text0_0=I'm going to need six crag boar ribs and a mug of Rhapsody Malt, $N.

[npctext 31420]
text0_0=The Malt is brewed, the Boars are dead$bAnd before all is done and anything said$bWe will have to fight for first dibs$bOn these savory Beer Basted Boar Ribs!

[npctext 31421]
text0_0=Your efforts in The Stockade were valiant, $N. It's obvious this problem is bigger than the both of us. But you have performed well and for that I am thankful.

[npctext 31422]
text0_0=I see you are back, $C. Have you collected 10 Red Wool Bandanas from those Defias Scum in The Stockade yet?

[npctext 31423]
text0_0=So these bandanas -- filthy tokens of corruption -- are what my $N had to die for? Such a waste. Such a tragic sacrifice. $b$bBut alas, I cannot return to the past. Just know, $N, that you have brought my family justice through your deeds.

[npctext 31424]
text0_0=What in the Light do you want? Can't you see we have a crisis here?$b$bBazil Thredd?! Why would you want to speak with that bastard? How am I supposed to know you're not one of his cronies, come down to help with his bloody riot? If all the blasted cells weren't open, I might throw you in one for a while!

[npctext 31425]
text0_0=Either you bring me Thredd's head, or I'll take yours, understand, $N?

[npctext 31426]
text0_0=Without Thredd to lead them, hopefully the riots will be more controllable. We shall see.$b$bI must say, after a half hour, I hardly expected you to come out, but it seems I misjudged you.$b$bI'd guess, then, that you didn't get much useful information out of him? But I know a thing or two that might be of interest to you about Thredd's activities.

[npctext 31427]
text0_0=Yes, $N? What have you found?

[npctext 31428]
text0_0=Hmm. Maelik? No, the name doesn't sound familiar and neither does this description. But it could be anybody! A former Stonemason, one of the Defias Brotherhood... Though if he is as well connected as Thelwater suggests, perhaps someone else might recognize him. Let me think.

[npctext 31429]
text0_0=Greetings. Of what service can I be to you, $C?

[npctext 31430]
text0_0=What? What's this? Yes, I think I do know who this man is, but his name is not Maelik. Assassins wear many names and many masks, discarding them as they lose their usefulness. Another alias known to be used by this man is Marzon; though even that is surely not his true name.$b$bRegardless, he is an assassin and I know a good deal about him.$b$bMarzon is currently under the employ of Lord Gregor Lescovar, a lord of shady reputation, even given the corruption of the nobility of Stormwind.

[npctext 31431]
text0_0=He is dead, then? Your justice was swift, $N. I pray to the Light that I never become your quarry!$b$b<He laughs and claps you on the shoulder.>$b$bI mean no criticism, $N. How could I, being the master of all assassins? But in truth, you have done the people of Stormwind a great service, and for that, I thank you.

[npctext 31432]
text0_0=It's good to see you, $N. I have heard that Lord Gregor Lescovar was found dead not long ago.$b$bIt would seem that you were successful in your mission. You have my gratitude that you have saved me, and many others, from VanCleef's revenge.

[npctext 31433]
text0_0=Yes?

[npctext 31434]
text0_0=Maggot Eye's dastardly acts have finally been avenged. Maybe your acts of valor will send a clear message to those who wish to bring harm to our people. On behalf of the town of Brill I thank you, $N.

[npctext 31435]
text0_0=$N! Did you have any luck?

[npctext 31436]
text0_0=Oh, thank you, $N! It's of no practical use to me, but the sentimental value... Needless to say, thank you for bringing this to me... at some cost to your own well-being, not to mention the time it took to go all the way down to Westfall. You have my gratitude, and have this as a token of my thanks.

[npctext 31437]
text0_0=Hm? You look a little young to be a siege engine pilot. But no matter...do you need something fixed?$b$bWell take a number and get comfortable. I'm working on a couple engines right now and won't have time for another job for at least a few days.$b$bOr, were you here for something else...?

[npctext 31438]
text0_0=You have my tools? Well done, lad, well done! I just broke my last fang-ratchet an hour ago and I need one of those to finish repairs on Pilot Stonegear's siege engine. You did a good thing by lugging those tools here, $N.$b$bHere, take these coins for your help.

[npctext 31439]
text0_0=Have you completed the task with which I have charged you? Do you have those Putrid Claws?

[npctext 31440]
text0_0=Well done. I regret not being there to see you smash those undead into rotting pulp!

[npctext 31441]
text0_0=Greetings. Either you do not know who I am, or your business with me is urgent.$b$bBecause if neither of these were true, then you would not be foolish enough to disturb me...

[npctext 31442]
text0_0=Ah, you are the agent sent by Magistrate Sevren. Then yes, your business with me is crucial.$b$bI trust Sevren has mustered someone suitable for my task...but we shall see.

[npctext 31443]
text0_0=Stay away foul and unholy creature! May the Light protect me! The Scarlet Crusade shall rid Azeroth of your. . .$b$b. . .oh wait. Is that food for me? I am so hungry. . .

[npctext 31444]
text0_0=By the Light! Finally some food! Sweet, sweet pumpkin. . . .

[npctext 31445]
text0_0=Time is not a luxury we have, $N. With each passing hour, the Scourge's hold on Tirisfal Glades grows more firm.

[npctext 31446]
text0_0=Your actions struck a telling blow against the Scourge. And your victory will not go unnoticed - not by the Forsaken, nor by our enemies.$b$bContinue the struggle as we all do, $N, and one day we will drive the Lich King himself from Azeroth!

[npctext 31447]
text0_0=You have defeated Lillith Nefara, proving you are an enemy of the Scourge. Incredible.$b$bI had believed I was the only Undead with free will, but you have shown me there are others who have broken the Lich King's domination.

[npctext 31448]
text0_0=Have you returned Gunther's book? Has he responded?

[npctext 31449]
text0_0=You convinced him to join us! You have done a great deed for the Forsaken, $N. The Dark Lady will be informed.

[npctext 31450]
text0_0=The Recombobulator will be up and running as soon as we have sufficient Restabilization Cogs and Gyromechanic Gears.

[npctext 31451]
text0_0=These Gyromechanic Gears and Restabilization Cogs are in perfect accordance with Ozzie's schematics for the Recombobulation Device. Once I add some hyrdolubricant to the inner combustion pistons, adjust the crank-o-ratchet and increase of the viscosity of the electrogum gel, the gnomish race will be as good as new.

[npctext 31452]
text0_0=Hello, $C! And what business takes you all the way out here?$b$bSomething exciting, I hope. I haven't been in a good fight in days, and this barrel of ale is almost dry...

[npctext 31453]
text0_0=<Mountaineer Barleybrew tastes the Shimmer Stout...>$b$bOh. Whoa! This stuff really puts a shine in your eyes. I feel like I can see in the dark!

[npctext 31454]
text0_0=Greetings, $C, and welcome to Thelsamar!

[npctext 31455]
text0_0=Now, let me have a taste...$b$bMagni's Beard! This stuff gets your head turning! And it lightens the limbs, too.$b$bI feel like I can fly!

[npctext 31456]
text0_0=$N! You know that Shimmerweed you brought me? Well I used it in a few recipes I've been working on, and one of them turned out great!$b$bHere, try it out and tell me what you think...

[npctext 31457]
text0_0=Hail, $N. How goes the rat catching?

[npctext 31458]
text0_0=Ugh! When I asked for those ears I didn't realize they'd smell so bad!$b$bHere's your reward, $N. Well done.

[npctext 31459]
text0_0=Hello, $N. Do you have word of my friend Hildelve?

[npctext 31460]
text0_0=This is grim news, for Hildelve was a good friend. And I wish I could have been there with you when you found the beast, Mangeclaw!$b$bThank you, $N. Your deed will be remembered by the pilots of the Ironforge Siege Brigade.

[npctext 31461]
text0_0=I'm all ready to start cooking, do you have the ingredients for me?

[npctext 31462]
text0_0=Trust me, it seems a lot harder than it looks, but...$b$bOh, I've never known someone to take much interest in the making of sausages, but I'll give you the recipe just in case. Here you go, mind you eat them fresh!

[npctext 31463]
text0_0=How are you? Like to share a drink with me, perhaps? Not much else to do in the cold.

[npctext 31464]
text0_0=What's this? Ah, my brother's report. Hmm...$b$bI told him to be sparing with the use of the King's name, but he didn't listen. No harm, I suppose, though it's sure to ruffle some feathers in the Senate. Not that those weren't some feathers that needed ruffling! Hah!$b$bNonetheless, I guess that means that I should send my report on to Ironforge as well, but I must admit I'm a bit behind. Bloody cold.$b$bI should have some work for you later, if you're interested.

[npctext 31465]
text0_0=You have served me well, $C. It is obvious to me that you will be a worthy aide to me as I prepare to rid Silverpine Forest of Arugal's curse.

[npctext 31466]
text0_0=Before I know what we are dealing with here, $C, I need to study the spell known as Remedy of Arugal. Bring it to me now or I shall be forced to find myself a worthy servant.

[npctext 31467]
text0_0=This is precisely the spell I was in search of, $C. If your dedication to The Dark Lady's cause remains infallible you will find you have quite a future amongst The Forsaken.

[npctext 31468]
text0_0=I will need 6 Glutton Shackles and 3 Darksoul Shackles before I can assess the situation and devise a final solution for Arugal. Now heed your bidding and slay Moonrage Gluttons and Moonrage Darksouls until you have what I need.

[npctext 31469]
text0_0=I hope I can acquire enough energy from such a limited sample. Perhaps I should have had you get more shackles.$b$bNonetheless, you showed great skill in collecting these, $C.

[npctext 31470]
text0_0=Has Grimson the Pale been slain? Varimathras will not be pleased if we ignore his bidding.

[npctext 31471]
text0_0=Most excellent. The mine will provide superb resources for our forces as we spread throughout Silverpine and into Azeroth.

[npctext 31472]
text0_0=Have you killed Ivar the Foul? If you won't do it for me and my brother, then do it for the Forsaken.

[npctext 31473]
text0_0=Ah, thank you. You have my gratitude, $N.$b$bAnd I will include you in the report I make to my superiors.

[npctext 31474]
text0_0=Our battles with the Scourge wage on, $N. Do your part and throw those cursed, mindless undead back into the Plaguelands!

[npctext 31475]
text0_0=Your efforts in the war are felt among us, $N. I will not thank you for doing what is necessary, but the Deathguards of Tirisfal will remember your name.

[npctext 31476]
text0_0=If you wish to prove your worth to The Dark Lady, slay 10 Scarlet Warriors, $C.

[npctext 31477]
text0_0=Most excellent, $C. Your skill in the art of combat is undeniable.

[npctext 31478]
text0_0=You found us! And not a moment too soon...

[npctext 31479]
text0_0=My time is short, $C, for the Dark Lady has charged me with a grave task.

[npctext 31480]
text0_0=<Renferrel takes the hearts>$b$bIt is troubling to hear our Deathstalkers have failed their mission.$b$bLet us hope that these failures are rare.$b$bI'll give you the potion in a moment, but here is its recipe - if those Deathstalkers find themselves in need of future aid, then perhaps you can give it yourself.

[npctext 31481]
text0_0=My sister told me you were here to aid us. Is that true?

[npctext 31482]
text0_0=<Quinn takes the potion and drinks it>$b$bYes, I can feel it working. I will soon be able to travel.$b$bYou have done me a great favor, $N.

[npctext 31483]
text0_0=Well, that makes me feel a little better...$b$bBut I won't be happy until they're all dead! All of them!

[npctext 31484]
text0_0=It is a start. Hopefully we can take advantage of it, and move some Mountaineers in to secure the area. Then we can begin to restore our infrastructure and get the miners back to work.$b$bThank you for your assistance, $N.

[npctext 31485]
text0_0=So it is done? Good. Thank you greatly for your discretion, $N. You've proven worthy on more than one count. I'll be sure to keep my eyes on you and your progress within the Alliance.$b$bBe sure to keep your nose clean.

[npctext 31486]
text0_0=Thank you for the aid, $N. I had feared Erland was overcome by the dangers of Silverpine. With your help, I see that he has not.

[npctext 31487]
text0_0=Jern wants to know what the slowdown is, eh?$b$bIronband is putting together his latest progress report with details, but I can tell you this:$b$bIt's the Troggs!!

[npctext 31488]
text0_0=Have you defeated Nightlash, $N? Our success against the rot hides depends on her destruction!

[npctext 31489]
text0_0=I heard of your successful raid against the rot hides, $N, and this essence is proof of Nightlash's death.$b$bThe Scourge have lost ground this day. Your value to the Forsaken grows.

[npctext 31490]
text0_0=Heaped within this boat is a pile of wrapped corpses. And looking east across Lordamere Lake, an opposing dock on Fenris Isle can be seen.$b$bThe fate of the corpses must lie on Fenris Isle.

[npctext 31491]
text0_0=$N. You return, so I assume your investigations bore fruit?

[npctext 31492]
text0_0=You say that this ring was worn by a woman, recently killed?$b$bThe only nearby source of such a body would be the mass graves in Tirisfal. The Rot Hide Gnolls must be taking those corpses to Fenris Isle!

[npctext 31493]
text0_0=Hello, $N. What brings you back to Brill?

[npctext 31494]
text0_0=A Deliah did live in Brill not long ago. She was buried in the mass grave but if what you say is true, then the Rot Hide Gnolls must have stolen her body and taken it to Silverpine.$b$bThe Rot Hides, like all the Scourge, must be destroyed. I trust you are taking steps to make that happen.

[npctext 31495]
text0_0=Do I know you?

[npctext 31496]
text0_0=Yes, this ring was my wife's. Her fate was the fate of all who fail to endure these harsh times. I feel nothing for her death, nor for the story you tell of her body's abduction.$b$bSuch feelings have long since grown cold within me. But desire does still burn in my dead heart, $N.$b$bDesire for revenge.

[npctext 31497]
text0_0=The Scourge cannot be allowed to remain in Silverpine, $N. Come back to me when you have proof of Thule's death.

[npctext 31498]
text0_0=The death of Thule Ravenclaw was no small event, $N. Renferrel tells me that the energies released when you destroyed Thule were felt even as far as the Sepulcher.$b$bYour actions ring through the ranks of the Forsaken. Your value to us grows.

[npctext 31499]
text0_0=Do you have the rot hide ichor, $N?

[npctext 31500]
text0_0=Very good. This ichor will help us understand the nature of the rot hides, and may show us their weakness...$b$b...if they have one.

[npctext 31501]
text0_0=My studies require great concentration. So I hope your visit is not a frivolous one.

[npctext 31502]
text0_0=This substance is laced with powerful spells, some of which I have not seen for a long, long time...$b$bOne moment -- I must invoke a spell of divination...

[npctext 31503]
text0_0=What business do you have with me, $C?

[npctext 31504]
text0_0=Ah, how good of Apothecary Johaan to send his research. With so many new developments here in Silverpine, I nearly forgot about the findings coming out of Lordaeron and Tirisfal Glades. Which reminds me, I need to get those samples off to the Necropolis soon.$b$bBut you must excuse my rambling. Extend your stay in Silverpine, $N. We could use an able bodied $C like you around here.

[npctext 31505]
text0_0=Greetings, $N. What did Bethor have to say?

[npctext 31506]
text0_0=This scroll is laced with powerful magic. I've never used such forces in a potion ... it will be a powerful mixture, and should serve you well should you attack Thule in his stronghold on Fenris Isle.

[npctext 31507]
text0_0=Hail, $C. What business do you have with the Royal Apothecary Society?

[npctext 31508]
text0_0=How good of Apothecary Renferrel to send you to me, $N. These samples will indeed prove useful to the cause. I will begin studying their toxic and contaminable properties at once.

[npctext 31509]
text0_0=If what Bethor says is true then Thule Ravenclaw is a force that must be dealt with, and dealt with soon.$b$bTo aid in this task, you may take something from our arsenal here...

[npctext 31510]
text0_0=Did you discover the fate of the Deathstalkers?

[npctext 31511]
text0_0=I hadn't accounted for the level of Scourge presence we've seen in Silverpine Forest, nor for the troubles our Deathstalkers have had in their scouting efforts.$b$bYour aid to our Deathstalkers was invaluable, $N. And you will be commended.

[npctext 31512]
text0_0=I see you are back, $N.

[npctext 31513]
text0_0=Apothecary Berard's journal! Why you are quite brave, $N. Now let's see what Berard was up to before he went mad. . .

[npctext 31514]
text0_0=What brings you back to the Undercity, $N?

[npctext 31515]
text0_0=Such a blow to the Royal Apothecary Society to lose Berard. But through your hard work and Apothecary Renferrel's diligent research Berard's studies will still be useful to The Dark Lady's plight.$b$bWe are on the cusp of something great here, $N. If you were not so skilled in the ways of combat I would try to recruit you for membership in the Society.

[npctext 31516]
text0_0=Hello, $C.$b$bYou'll be escorting me to the excavation site? That's good to hear... After Saean and his cronies, who knows what else the Dark Irons might have up their sleeves?$b$bAnyways, let me just make some final checks. Talk to me again when you're ready to go.

[npctext 31517]
text0_0=Your report is full of bad news!$b$bI see the Dragonmaws are making a strong move into Algaz. Normally the Dragonmaws just hide up in the hills. What made them surge into Algaz is still a mystery...$b$bThank you, $N. And we'll probably want your help dealing with these orcs.

[npctext 31518]
text0_0=There is still work to be done, $N. Return to me once you have thinned the nightsaber and thistle boar populations.

[npctext 31519]
text0_0=You performed your duties well, $N.

[npctext 31520]
text0_0=Your task is not yet complete, Snowdogchar. Return to me once 8 mangy nightsabers and 8 thistle boars have been killed.

[npctext 31521]
text0_0=You have proven your dedication to nature well, $N. A young $C like yourself has a promising future.

[npctext 31522]
text0_0=I see you found me, young $R. Melithar is a wise $C to have sent you.

[npctext 31523]
text0_0=Satisfy my suspicions, $N. Bring to me 8 Fel Moss.

[npctext 31524]
text0_0=Your service to the creatures of Shadowglen is worthy of reward, $N.$b$bYou confirmed my fears, however. If the grells have become tainted by the Fel Moss, one can only imagine what has become of the Gnarlpine tribe of furbolgs who once lived here.$b$bShould you find yourself in Dolanaar, able $C, seek out the knowledgeable $C, Athridas Bearmantle. He shares our concern for the well being of the forest.

[npctext 31525]
text0_0=This grave was hastily dug.

[npctext 31526]
text0_0=Thank you, $N. I had feared the Gnolls destroyed my body. It is good to know they did not.

[npctext 31527]
text0_0=This is the spot! Bring me closer...

[npctext 31528]
text0_0=There we are, it's open. Leave me here. I spent the best days of my life in this keep, and the thought of resting within its walls gives me comfort.$b$bBe sure to close the alcove tight - I don't want those Rot Hides to find me.$b$bOh, and take this. You've earned it.

[npctext 31529]
text0_0=Have you attacked the Dragonmaw encampment?

[npctext 31530]
text0_0=Well fought, $N. The Dragonmaws are not the same threat they were when they had dragons, but they're still fierce opponents.$b$bThe Dragonmaws are led by Nek'rosh, son of Nekros, who was the former head of the Dragonmaws years ago. Nekros used powerful magic to tame the Red Dragons, but when that magic failed him...the dragons were not happy.$b$bNekros was killed, and his son has vowed revenge against the dragons who slew his father.

[npctext 31531]
text0_0=Where is that ore, $N?!

[npctext 31532]
text0_0=You got the ore! Well done, $N! I'll get someone to work with this right away. Let's hope he doesn't blow himself up!

[npctext 31533]
text0_0=Hello, $C! You're here for the scouting mission, are you? Very good!$b$bI hope your gear is in good condition, because this "scouting" mission has changed into something more messy...

[npctext 31534]
text0_0=Hello there, $C. Could I interest you in a pair of boots? Perhaps some newly cured skins?

[npctext 31535]
text0_0=Hmm, this is from Einar, right? Hasn't delivered his skins to me in person for almost a week now. No doubt it's some differences with the wife!$b$bMaybe I'll have my wife go speak with Sida sometime...

[npctext 31536]
text0_0=My apprentice is like a son to me. It's going to be hard for him to live his life with only one leg.$b$bAh, $N, how goes it? Do you have my skins?

[npctext 31537]
text0_0=Hmm... Don't suppose you'd be interested in becoming my apprentice, would you?$b$bHah! No, I'm just kidding. You're much too old, for one thing. Besides - from the looks of you, it would seem that you have other ambitions in life. Nonetheless, these are some fine skins you've procured, and I'll be able to put them to good use.

[npctext 31538]
text0_0=What brave $C sends word from Menethil? Ah $N, they call you.$b$bYou bring hope to a hopeless situation. 'Tis good news indeed that young Harlo survived. While fleeing he received a grievous wound. We had but little time to send him on his way on the back of the only surviving steed with the regiment.$b$bBut now we face a perilous situation. Dun Modr has fallen and we are but a shadow of the great regiment we once were.

[npctext 31539]
text0_0=$N. Valstag briefed me on your past success with the Dragonmaw Orcs at Dun Algaz. You're a $R of worth.$b$bAnd I have a task for you.

[npctext 31540]
text0_0=Thank the forest spirits you are here! I knew Athridas would sense trouble and send help.

[npctext 31541]
text0_0=By the stars! This is quite disturbing indeed!

[npctext 31542]
text0_0=<Prying open the lid of the crate, you find an assortment of carefully-packed objects. On the top of the crate lies a bundle of maps, yellowing with age, that appear to depict Silverpine Forest and other parts of western Lordaeron.$b$bUnderneath the maps is a mysterious-looking magical pendant.>

[npctext 31543]
text0_0=Have you learned anything useful, $N?

[npctext 31544]
text0_0=Maps and this... pendant, hm? Interesting.$b$bIt is obvious that the Dalaran wizards are interested in Ambermill for some purpose, but still, their aim is hidden to me.$b$bPerhaps Dalar will know something of their use.

[npctext 31545]
text0_0=We must hurry, their plans must not come to fruition, or we may lose our hold on Silverpine Forest.

[npctext 31546]
text0_0=Dalar has found that the weaving is quite far along, despite the setback.$b$bA wizard of great power is guiding the magic energy. He must be stopped quickly.

[npctext 31547]
text0_0=Quickly, time runs short, $N!

[npctext 31548]
text0_0=The magic of the wizards dissipates, and the ley energies fade into dormancy. Your efforts have been fruitful, $N, and we have dealt a major blow to our enemies, and to the overbearing wizards of Dalaran.$b$bWe must be vigilant, however, knowing that source of energy lies so close at hand... Plans must be made for the future.

[npctext 31549]
text0_0=Yes, $C? What is it?

[npctext 31550]
text0_0=Interesting, more machinations of the Kirin Tor, it would seem. This is a powerful artifact. It was used frequently by powerful wizards of the Kirin Tor to channel magical energies.$b$bThat they are delivering so many to Ambermill indicates that they must be undergoing a project of some magnitude.$b$bI will see if I can pierce their shields and ascertain their intent.

[npctext 31551]
text0_0=Ill news you bring, $N. If Dalar is correct--and I've no reason to believe he isn't--we must move quickly.$b$bI must confer with him on our plan of attack. But in the meanwhile we will have to delay their progress.

[npctext 31552]
text0_0=$N, the kidnapped Druids of the Talon will be forever trapped in the Emerald Dream if we cannot retrieve the Relics of Wakening from the Ban'ethil Barrow Den to the west.$b$bFor every minute we delay their fate comes one step closer to eternal doom.

[npctext 31553]
text0_0=You have succeeded, young $C! Well done. And just in time I might add.

[npctext 31554]
text0_0=$N, right? Do you have my skins?

[npctext 31555]
text0_0=Nice work you've done here, $N. The quality of these skins is superb. I'll have to get them into the curing process as soon as possible. Oh, but before I get to that, there's some other work I need done that I think you might be able to take care of.

[npctext 31556]
text0_0=You appear to have uncovered the wreckage of... a robotic chicken? The voice from within the egg crackles to life again:$b$b"Yes, excellent work! This is indeed my homing robot, though my sensors indicate that it needs a jump start before it can fly back to Booty Bay for repairs. Go ahead and place the beacon inside the rover - the beacon will take care of the rest!"

[npctext 31557]
text0_0=You place the egg... distress beacon... inside the chicken... homing robot.$b$bHums and whirs are heard from inside the robot as it struggles to stand up. After the robot comes to life, Oglethorpe's voice is heard once more, but now from inside the robot:$b$b"OOX-09/HL is working at least, but it needs major repairs! It is much too heavy for you to carry it... but I think I have an idea. Are you up for watching over it some more?"

[npctext 31558]
text0_0=$N you have proven yourself a most worthy and able $C. A night elf who follows the path of honor as sure as you do is certain to find great glory in this world.$b$bMay the forest spirits protect you wherever your travels may take you.

[npctext 31559]
text0_0=Have you been a busy little bee, $N? I've been waiting for you to bring me what I need.

[npctext 31560]
text0_0=Ha ha! Well, done indeed.$b$bWho would have ever guessed that I, Zenn Foulhoof, would have a $R to do my bidding? Certainly not me! But so it goes... this beloved world of ours is full of surprises.$b$bThree cheers for the naive and gullible!

[npctext 31561]
text0_0=What do you have for me, $N? A lovely snack I presume?

[npctext 31562]
text0_0=Ah, what a sweet $R! I knew you would come in handy!

[npctext 31563]
text0_0=$N. Have you defeated Thule Ravenclaw?

[npctext 31564]
text0_0=...what is this? Thule had our Woven Wand? I thought it was lost when our friendship sundered and he sided with the Lich King!$b$bHe must not have invoked its power, for if he had I would have sensed it. And it is good that he did not use it...$b$bThis is a marvelous find. You have my gratitude, $N, and will be rewarded.

[npctext 31565]
text0_0=You have something for me?

[npctext 31566]
text0_0=Ah, most excellent. Apothecary Renferrel has my utmost respect. I am anxious to study his work.

[npctext 31567]
text0_0=The raven's cry from the west doth beckon?$b$bSuperb news! Hillsbrad is ripe for attack. We can carry out our plan of destruction now. Varimathras will be pleased.

[npctext 31568]
text0_0=I see you are back. I hope you were able to gather the agents I need. Another deathless day will put me in such a gloomy mood.

[npctext 31569]
text0_0=These specimens are perfect. Well, $N, you have managed to bring me the slightest hint of joy on yet another miserable day. Your efforts are appreciated.

[npctext 31570]
text0_0=You must make haste, $C. I shudder to think what the humans might be doing to Drull and Tog'thar.

[npctext 31571]
text0_0=So the humans thought to turn our warriors into slaves, did they? We'll show them!$b$bIt would seem that they have taken Gol'dir, our leader, to another location. We must find him and rescue him. But we currently have no clue where he is...$b$bWhen we have a lead, I will be sure to tell you, $N.

[npctext 31572]
text0_0=Ribbit!

[npctext 31573]
text0_0=Croak!

[npctext 31574]
text0_0=I remember you, $N. You were going to help me out in concocting my latest elixir. I'll need that blood before I can bring my own special brand of misery to the inhabitants of Hillsbrad.

[npctext 31575]
text0_0=Superb collecting, $N.

[npctext 31576]
text0_0=Woof?

[npctext 31577]
text0_0=You pour some of the elixir into your hand and hold it before Stanley's mouth.

[npctext 31578]
text0_0=Give me the key, $C, I will undo the lock myself.

[npctext 31579]
text0_0=Thank you, $N. I led the expedition from Durotar under the Warchief's orders, but as you can see, our plans went somewhat awry. They have held me captive here in this town, forcing me to work, hauling burdens, digging...$b$bWhat I have suffered is unimportant, however. There is important information you must deliver to whomever is leading our group now.

[npctext 31580]
text0_0=The nerve of those overbearing humans! We'll show them that the orcs shall never submit to their will!$b$bThis will now be our mission, in addition to recovering the trinket the Warchief desires. It would seem that by accomplishing one, we will also accomplish the other.

[npctext 31581]
text0_0=No, no please don't hurt me! I never meant your people any harm, he's had me against my will! Please... spare me!

[npctext 31582]
text0_0=You've returned, $N. Success to report?

[npctext 31583]
text0_0=It is strange that the Warchief would expend so much over such a small thing. I do not claim to understand him, but I will follow him, whatever his commands. You did well, $N, no doubt the Warchief will be glad to hear of your success.

[npctext 31584]
text0_0=Any luck at Nethander Stead?

[npctext 31585]
text0_0=Ah, the horrible reek of Mudsnout Blossoms. At least those filthy Gnolls are good for something.

[npctext 31586]
text0_0=Can you not see I am busy, $C? The Dark Lady insists on a new plague before the Scourge advance from Northrend overwhelms us. And with the human threat pressing from the south, time becomes my most precious commodity. This better be important!

[npctext 31587]
text0_0=Apothecary Lydon sent you? Ah, why didn't you say so!$b$bDespite his gloomy disposition, Apothecary Lydon is one of our most dedicated and skilled members.$b$bThe good chap sends Mudsnout Composite! I know what our friend in Hillsbrad is up to now. And I like the way he thinks. The Dark Lady would be most impressed with the progress he is making toward the new plague.

[npctext 31588]
text0_0=So glad to see you back, $N. I was growing so terribly bored here. Not a single entertaining thing to do besides poison and disease Umpi and reanimate her. . .over and over and over again.$b$bHow went the trip to the Undercity? Were you fortunate enough to slaughter any humans along the way?

[npctext 31589]
text0_0=The excitement of this experiment has me feeling giddy! You have been such a great help, $N. Together we will spread death and disease to this land!

[npctext 31590]
text0_0=Have you located their base yet, $N? Time is of the essence!

[npctext 31591]
text0_0=If our scouts and agents continue to procure valuable information such as this, we shall have the Lich King's Scourge removed from our lands in no time.

[npctext 31592]
text0_0=Sometimes I get so bored out here in Tarren Mill I like to open up the formaldehyde jar and let the lovely aroma waft through the air. Makes Umpi a little nervous though.$b$bSo were you able to get a keg from the Dwarves? I swear if I have to stare at this deadly elixir without using on it someone for another day I am going to scream.

[npctext 31593]
text0_0=Finally! Now we are ready for action!

[npctext 31594]
text0_0=I want their heads, $N, not excuses.

[npctext 31595]
text0_0=...and I thought ogres smelled foul enough to begin with.$b$bWhen you bring me Mug'Thol's head, I will have the four of them mounted on pikes above Alterac. A fitting monument to those who go against the Dark Lady's wishes.

[npctext 31596]
text0_0=Three heads I have, a fourth I need. It will be Mug'Thol's, or it will be yours, $N. That I promise.

[npctext 31597]
text0_0=You have done your duty well, $N. Mug'Thol's head shall adorn the highest peak of the ruins of Alterac, and the Deathguard will sweep the remnants of the Crushridge into the ground.

[npctext 31598]
text0_0=Yes? Do you have something to report?

[npctext 31599]
text0_0=So this is the relic the ogre used to duck the will of the Dark Lady...$b$bStrange that something so simple could wield so great a power. And to fall into as clumsy hands as those. Well done, $N, I will deliver the crown to Lady Sylvanas, and see that she hears of your accomplishment.

[npctext 31600]
text0_0=A musty smell emanates from the rug.

[npctext 31601]
text0_0=You rest the tainted deg on the dusty rug.

[npctext 31602]
text0_0=At ease, $C. I see you have returned from battle. My sources tell me you performed well on the Hillsbrad front.

[npctext 31603]
text0_0=The grip of death is tightening around the town of Hillsbrad. The battle goes well.

[npctext 31604]
text0_0=Were you able to carry out your orders, $C? Did you dispose of Verringtan and his assistants? And where is that iron shipment?

[npctext 31605]
text0_0=Mission accomplished, $C. And carried out quite skillfully, I might add.

[npctext 31606]
text0_0=Do you have those hands, $N?

[npctext 31607]
text0_0=Ah, good. These hands killed my wife, Deliah. Revenge for her murder was my only care, and you were the instrument of that revenge.$b$bHere, take the ring you returned earlier. Deliah has been dead to me for so long, her ring is a bauble I no longer care to keep. Instead, I will keep these hands as a remembrance of my friend's betrayal.

[npctext 31608]
text0_0=What news have you?

[npctext 31609]
text0_0=News of your glories in Hillsbrad traveled fast. You have done well, $C.

[npctext 31610]
text0_0=Have you found anything? I fear Gol'dir's prospects grow worse by the day...

[npctext 31611]
text0_0=Finally, we know where Gol'dir is being held. The camp in question is not too far from here, and hopefully they will not be as well prepared as they were when they captured us the first time.

[npctext 31612]
text0_0=I hope this will be enough to convince Redpath that I've--ha!--been carrying out his orders and ridding Southshore of the terrible and horrible menace of the dreaded murlocs! For there could be no greater evil than the ravages of overgrown fish!

[npctext 31613]
text0_0=The Dark Lady will be pleased when she learns that she has a new mine from which she can arm her soldiers.

[npctext 31614]
text0_0=Salutations, Pluto. Do try to avoid stepping on my pant cuffs. This outfit is newly tailored.

[npctext 31615]
text0_0=Ah, this is splendid. This will have to be cleaned of course, but you really outdid yourself, Pluto. I will have someone prepare the tiara and place it within our collection posthaste.$b$bAs I'm sure you will agree, our gratitude is as grand as our collection.

[npctext 31616]
text0_0=Did you find the thieves? And more importantly, did you find what they stole?

[npctext 31617]
text0_0=You have done a great service for the Forsaken, $N. These artifacts have been sorely missed.$b$bAnd it is good to hear that Kegan and the other betrayers have found justice.

[npctext 31618]
text0_0=So the lucky $N returns? How many humans have you slaughtered today? Hundreds I do hope!$b$bHave you any skulls for me?

[npctext 31619]
text0_0=Precious skulls! So beautiful! I owe you as promised, $N!

[npctext 31620]
text0_0=Were you able to retrieve my sword, $N? High Executor Darthalia will hang me from the rafters if she discovers my folly.

[npctext 31621]
text0_0=You found it!$b$bAh, I feel so complete with my precious sword back in my hand. Many thanks to you!

[npctext 31622]
text0_0=What brings a $C all the way to the Undercity from the battlefield?

[npctext 31623]
text0_0=So you are the infamous $C who struck such a decisive blow against the Alliance forces in the Hillsbrad Foothills? Word of your glorious exploits traveled quickly to the Undercity.$b$bYou have quite a future in the Dark Lady's ranks if you continue to show such leadership and expertise in battle.$b$bWhile our primary threat is the Lich King's Scourge army descending from the north, the human "problem" continues to impede our battle plans. You, however, have shown that the humans can and will fall.

[npctext 31624]
text0_0=Have you recovered Helcular's Rod yet? There are so many Yeti in this region, it will be very difficult to locate. But we must have it in order to proceed.

[npctext 31625]
text0_0=You found it! Most excellent, $N!

[npctext 31626]
text0_0=Helcular's grave teems with a mystical energy.

[npctext 31627]
text0_0=A great rumbling emanates from the ground.

[npctext 31628]
text0_0=Do you have the Worn Stone Tokens, $N? The Magus is eager to unlock their secrets.

[npctext 31629]
text0_0=These will do nicely. Although it looks like their magic is faded, it would be best if the Magus' initial experiments were on inert specimens such as these.$b$bThank you, $N.

[npctext 31630]
text0_0=Hello, $N. Elementals are tough quarry, but I know you're up to the task. Do you have those bracers of binding?

[npctext 31631]
text0_0=You found them. I trust the elementals from which you removed these bracers were amenable?$b$bHm...death has not only stopped my heart, but robbed me of my comedic timing, it seems.$b$bWell thank you, $N. You serve the Magus, and hence the Dark Lady, well.

[npctext 31632]
text0_0=Did you get those heads for me, Nibler?

[npctext 31633]
text0_0=Oh for the Love of the Light... they're dripping on the ground.$b$bCan't stand touching those things, myself. Fish are all well and good, but when they grow legs and start walking around... Haven't eaten a fish in weeks, let me tell you, and in Southshore, that means you aren't eating much.

[npctext 31634]
text0_0=Greetings, citizen. Have you come to lend your arm to upholding the safety of Southshore?

[npctext 31635]
text0_0=Farren's errand boy, are you?$b$bIf you assisted Farren in procuring these heads, then thank you. Southshore needs hard workers and effort to maintain its protection.

[npctext 31636]
text0_0=The naga, eh? Redpath must have just received the same information as me... Ha! He'll not receive a promotion from my toil. Let me explain.

[npctext 31637]
text0_0=Greetings, citizen. May the Stormwind city guard be of assistance?

[npctext 31638]
text0_0=What's this? Ah... so my attentive pupil has applied himself to the problem of the naga in Southshore. Thank you for bringing this to me, I will certainly take it into account when I review personnel assignments in the next month.

[npctext 31639]
text0_0=So you have returned to the great Bartolo. Perhaps you have finished gathering the materials needed for your Yeti Fur Cloak? Or maybe you just enjoy basking in the greatness of me, Bartolo!

[npctext 31640]
text0_0=Now it is time for the great Bartolo to work his magic! I require no wizard's staff, no $C's rod. For I, the great Bartolo, work magic with a mere needle and thread!

[npctext 31641]
text0_0=You are quite the bounty $C, $C. Well done.

[npctext 31642]
text0_0=Your duty was performed with honor, $C.

[npctext 31643]
text0_0=Have you made any progress with the ogres of the Mizjah Ruins yet, $C?

[npctext 31644]
text0_0=Well done. You have served the Warchief with honor.

[npctext 31645]
text0_0=What news do you bring?

[npctext 31646]
text0_0=Your knowledge of the jungle is strong, $N. These specimens will be perfect. I will thank the spirits for sacrificing such fine beasts for the cause of the Horde.

[npctext 31647]
text0_0=Has fortune been on your side, $N? Were you able to obtain an aged gorilla sinew?

[npctext 31648]
text0_0=A most ideal sinew, $N. Your efforts will pay off soon.

[npctext 31649]
text0_0=Did your gathering efforts prove fruitful?

[npctext 31650]
text0_0=Most excellent. I will prepare these at once.

[npctext 31651]
text0_0=Sergeant Yohwa tells me you are skilled and brave, $C. Do you have something to rep

[npctext 31652]
text0_0=$N. Sergeant Yohwa trusted your abilities, and I trust her. The defeat you brought to Kurzen's forces is almost too much to hope for. I had feared we rebels were alone, and alone we could never stand up against the Colonel's brilliance.$b$bPerhaps hope of our survival yet remains.

[npctext 31653]
text0_0=My equipment is all ready to go, $N, I just need those skins. We don't want to keep Riddlevox waiting, that's for sure.$b$bIt's not a good idea for anyone to keep the chief inventor of the Tinkers' Union unsatisfied.

[npctext 31654]
text0_0=These skins should do. Their quality isn't too important, given that they'll make up the inside layer of the boots, but it's still important that they're comfortable.$b$bIf they're a bit too rigid, I'll use some tiger blood to soften it up. Tricks o' the trade, you know?

[npctext 31655]
text0_0=Ahoy, me bucko! Might not be able to see but I can smell ye from halfway across port.$b$bCould really use me eye back. Captain's going to keelhaul me when he finds out me peeper is in the hands of them dirty Bloodsail Buccaneers.$b$bWhat good is a lookout who can't see? The crow's nest used to be me home...without me deadlights I'd be lucky to scrub the bilge.

[npctext 31656]
text0_0=Shiver me timbers and timber me shivers! Ye found me beautiful eye! Let's see if she still fits.$b$bShavas ho! Blimey, I can see!!

[npctext 31657]
text0_0=Drizzlik's Excelsior leather boots, finest workmanship, one-hundred percent high quality saltwater crocilisk skin boots. None finer!$b$bCan't beat a glowing description like that, can you?$b$bExcept, maybe, if you have those skins for me?

[npctext 31658]
text0_0=My boots... they're like sausages, $N. Look great, taste great. I tell you they're filled with nothing but the finest ingredients and meats, and you eat it, and you love it.$b$bIt's safer--and more enjoyable--if you just trust me, and don't ask too carefully what's really inside.

[npctext 31659]
text0_0=Sink me! I'm almost outta booze here! Cap'n is goin' to weigh anchor and Ol' Slim will be caught dry as the Tanaris Desert. And once he discovers his port is missing. . . blimey!

[npctext 31660]
text0_0=Shiver me timbers! Ye found the Cap'n's grog!$b$bI owe ye big time, friend.$b$bSeems like a storm is a brewin' outside. Maybe I'll just keep warm with one o' these here bottles while we wait for it to pass....

[npctext 31661]
text0_0=$C. Show me you have made prey of the Bloodscalp tribe.$b$bShow me your trophies.

[npctext 31662]
text0_0=These are good tusks, $N. You prove that you have the strength to hunt the Bloodscalps.$b$bAnd that is good, because you are not done hunting them.

[npctext 31663]
text0_0=$N. I fear for our chief's son. Do you have the shrunken heads so I may inspect them?

[npctext 31664]
text0_0=Thank you, $N. I will inspect these heads to ensure poor Yenniku was spared the headhunter's axe.

[npctext 31665]
text0_0=Jolly nice to make your acquaintance, $N. Haven't seen a $C around these parts for some time.$b$bI situated myself with this expedition for one purpose: to hunt a great and elusive beast. Seeing that you're a hero of sorts I am willing to let you take part in the hunt, but you must first prove yourself.$b$bI shall teach the ways of raptor killing to you. Ajeck will train you with tiger hunting. And Sir Erlgadin is a master of panther tracking.$b$bProve your skill and I'll let you in on the big hunt.

[npctext 31666]
text0_0=The greenish broth within the cauldron bubbles.

[npctext 31667]
text0_0=You place the heads of Gan'zulah and Nezzliok within the cauldron...

[npctext 31668]
text0_0=I await the skulls...

[npctext 31669]
text0_0=Yes. These will serve me well. When my spirit is freed, I will enter the Nether with three fine servants!$b$bYou are a credit to your $R clan, and you have appeased me.

[npctext 31670]
text0_0=Although my own flesh boils off my skull, I can still smell your fear.$b$bHah! You will never complete my task...

[npctext 31671]
text0_0=I do not want to believe it, but I cannot deny what you have done. And my rage eases, now that Ana'thek is defeated. $b$bYour might will drive you to great deeds, $N. But one day...I will see you in the Nether and we will again match strength.$b$bI will be waiting.

[npctext 31672]
text0_0=Any luck finding the goods, matey?

[npctext 31673]
text0_0=Good show, $N! And just before I need to ship out too! Can't thank you enough, old friend.

[npctext 31674]
text0_0=Zanzil the Outcast??$b$bIf Yenniku is held by that troll, a vile and powerful witchdoctor, then I fear that only a faint hope remains. Faint. And tiny as the smallest insect.$b$bBut still, it is hope.

[npctext 31675]
text0_0=Do you have the shards, $N? They are needed for my final ritual, after we have the Mind's Eye.

[npctext 31676]
text0_0=You have done well, $N. These shards are well formed. Already I hear them sing to me.$b$bAnd while you were gone, I spoke with the spirits of the jungle. I know where the Mind's Eye rests...$b$b...And who guards it.

[npctext 31677]
text0_0=Incredible! What skill!$b$bThought you'd be easy prey, $N. Got me good, you did.$b$bHere's the coin I promised... not as much as I said it'd be, but that's on a count o' me lying to ya in the first place.

[npctext 31678]
text0_0=Greetings, $N. The spirits sing praise of your bravery, yet they tell me no tales of your quest against Mai'Zoth.$b$bDo you have the Eye?

[npctext 31679]
text0_0=You retrieved the eye! Your might is the stuff of legends, $N!$b$bAnd in getting the Eye, you must have defeated Mai'Zoth and sent him to the Nether. That is why the spirits would not mention him before.$b$bIt is good that he is gone from the world of flesh and bone, but now that he is in the realm of spirits...I fear he will begin a new reign.$b$bBut that is a worry for another time. Now, I must perform a ritual to bend the Mind's Eye to our needs...

[npctext 31680]
text0_0=$N. Kin'weelay told me you set out to capture Yenniku.$b$bIs it true? Do you have him?

[npctext 31681]
text0_0=You've done it! You freed Yenniku from the will of Zanzil, and completed the mission I had thought was so desperate.$b$bOur tribe will remember your name in songs, $N, and we will etch your tale in stone so that it will live forever.

[npctext 31682]
text0_0=Have you come to free me?

[npctext 31683]
text0_0=Inside the skiff, you discover a map with some hastily written text on it along with some coins.

[npctext 31684]
text0_0=The Bloodscalps will one day be crushed by the Darkspears! Do you have the necklaces of our doomed foe?

[npctext 31685]
text0_0=Ah, very good. I will boil these, and leech them, and the spirits of their owners will weaken as I render their necklaces to paste!$b$bHere, $N. This will repay my debt to you.

[npctext 31686]
text0_0=Sure, I remember you, $C. Back from scouting I see....

[npctext 31687]
text0_0=The Skullsplitters will curse the day they brought us to war! Is your task complete?

[npctext 31688]
text0_0=Your strength is great to have gained these necklaces, $N. The Skullsplitters fall to you like young saplings stomped to earth by a Basilisk!$b$bYour deeds are a boon to us.

[npctext 31689]
text0_0=Bloodsail Buccaneers attacking Booty Bay? They might as well throw themselves off the Overlook Cliffs. Nonetheless, by bringing me this information you have done my fleet of swashbucklers a great service. The Blackwater Raiders thank you.

[npctext 31690]
text0_0=Do you have those crystals?? I need them!!$b$bI mean...I need to know the evil Venture Company is losing ground in Stranglethorn. Because, you know, we honest folk have to make a living!

[npctext 31691]
text0_0=Great! Wonderful! I can get a bundle for these!!$b$bThat Venture Company sure picked the wrong jungle to mine in, didn't they? We'd all be in better shape if they moved out of here.$b$bThank you, $N. You've done a good deed this day.

[npctext 31692]
text0_0=Have you had any luck,

[npctext 31693]
text0_0=Ahoy, $N. What word do you bring of the Bloodsail encampment to the south?

[npctext 31694]
text0_0=Perfect, $N. Now that we know their plan, it's just a matter of time.$b$bAnd to think the fools have dropped anchor just off the cape....

[npctext 31695]
text0_0=Do you have those shards yet? I'll give you a decent cut from the profits!

[npctext 31696]
text0_0=Aha! These will do nicely, $N. Yes, quite nicely!$b$bHere is your cut, and...it was a pleasure doing business with you.

[npctext 31697]
text0_0=Hey! I don't like the look you're giving me, mister.

[npctext 31698]
text0_0=Ack! Where'd you get these? No, don't tell me. I don't want to know!$b$bWho sent you? Sea Wolf?

[npctext 31699]
text0_0=Here here, $N. Did you get Shaky's payment?

[npctext 31700]
text0_0=Heh heh, well done! And when you showed Shaky those giblets, how hard did he shake?$b$bHah! He's so easy to read, when I play cards with him I can't help but win!$b$bThanks for your help, $N. Now it's your turn to get paid...

[npctext 31701]
text0_0=What's the problem, $N? We need to attack before the Bloodsail Buccaneers do!

[npctext 31702]
text0_0=Ah, what a great day for the Blackwater Raiders! Three cheers to you, $N!

[npctext 31703]
text0_0=$N, did you find those three dogs? Did you collect their valuables?

[npctext 31704]
text0_0=Great! I can get a good price for these, especially for what's inside Maury's foot! Thanks much, $N!$b$bI hope those three learned their lesson: don't bet something you can't afford to lose.$b$bAnd maybe it's too late for them, but...they should be careful of who they gamble with.

[npctext 31705]
text0_0=I'd never been beat before, you know, Pluto? Sure I'd been cut, can't get in a knife fight without that, but he just smacked me on the side of the head, blacked me out. When I came to my blade was gone.$b$bAs much as my nickname might indicate, I still need a knife to fight, and for me, it has to be that one.

[npctext 31706]
text0_0=You beat Duncan? I guess you aren't as wet behind the ears as you looked at first glance.$b$bI suppose that also means I shouldn't challenge you to a fight any time soon!

[npctext 31707]
text0_0=Ahoy, $N! Have you yet found Maury's Key?

[npctext 31708]
text0_0=You found it! Thanks a million, $N. You've been a big help to me!$b$bHere you go - you earned this!

[npctext 31709]
text0_0=Ahoy, $N! Did you find Gorlash? That chest was my favorite, and it has a hidden compartment that held my greatest treasures!

[npctext 31710]
text0_0=You found it! Oh happy day, this is! Thank you, $N. Getting back my chest cools some of the fire in me.$b$bBut my revenge isn't complete...

[npctext 31711]
text0_0=Interesting. Some time ago, I seem to remember reading a book once that suggested...$b$bAh, of course, a troll legend it was. If what Krazek reports is true, perhaps I will soon be able to add the Stone of the Tides to my collection of ancient artifacts and relics.

[npctext 31712]
text0_0=If ya got no business with me, then move along, $N.

[npctext 31713]
text0_0=Well done, $N. 10 stalks of akiris reed wasn't too much a challenge after all, huh? No offense to the naga, but hey, everybody's gotta make a living.

[npctext 31714]
text0_0=Do you have the samples of Zanzil's Mixture??

[npctext 31715]
text0_0=Ah, very good! Here is your pay.$b$bAnd here is a little something extra... for your discretion.

[npctext 31716]
text0_0=The soggy parchment contains the next clue....

[npctext 31717]
text0_0=The soggy parchment contains the next clue....

[npctext 31718]
text0_0=The soggy parchment contains the next clue....

[npctext 31719]
text0_0=I read somewhere that the saltwater crocilisks are slowly dying out... bad news for my business, isn't it?$b$bAnyways, I hope you have that elder saltwater crocolisk skin for me!

[npctext 31720]
text0_0=Great! Thanks to your help I'll have this order filled and sent off to Director Riddlevox on the next boat to Undermine. Ahead of schedule, even!$b$bFor all your hard work, here, I made some extras, so take a pair. It's on Drizzlik.$b$bAnd remember, there's no boot so fine as one of Drizzlik's Excelsior line!

[npctext 31721]
text0_0=I await the Tablet Shard, $N.

[npctext 31722]
text0_0=This is good. When I return to Orgrimmar I will place this shard in a sacred place. It will remind us of the might and honor of Gri'lek.$b$bThank you, $N. Your deeds mark a growing friendship with the Darkspear tribe.

[npctext 31723]
text0_0=I thank my ancestors someone has come to aid me. Do you have the key that will free me?

[npctext 31724]
text0_0=$N, you have saved me from a great dishonor. If it was within my power, I would offer you a place among my tribe. But for now, all I can only offer you is this token for the courage and nobility you have shown.

[npctext 31725]
text0_0=Any sign of Ol' Rustlocke, Nibler?

[npctext 31726]
text0_0=Oh my, the news is grave....

[npctext 31727]
text0_0=The remaining bridge is saved! You have done a great service to King Magni and the people of Khaz Modan.$b$bNow if we can only hold out long enough for reinforcements to show...

[npctext 31728]
text0_0=My condolences go out to Longbraid and his brave soldiers. The news of the Thandol Span tragedy and the fall of Dun Modr hangs heavy in my heart.$b$bBut Stromgarde has fallen! Hence our presence here at Refuge Pointe. We are faced with retaking our own great city.$b$bHonor and duty require that we do not leave the Highlands until Stromgarde raises the mighty banner of the King once again. I will send word to Longbraid that he is on his own...

[npctext 31729]
text0_0=This crystal pulses, as if a living force is trapped within it.

[npctext 31730]
text0_0=How you doing, $C? The task set before us by Vol'jin will be a difficult one, and any assistance you might provide will be appreciated and necessary.

[npctext 31731]
text0_0=Have you located the first sigil yet? It is most likely carried on the person of one of the Syndicate agents in Stromgarde.

[npctext 31732]
text0_0=Excellent, mon. That's a good start to collecting the sigils we'll need to remove Trol'kalar from Trollbane's tomb.

[npctext 31733]
text0_0=Throm'ka, $C. Zengu informed me that you required my assistance?

[npctext 31734]
text0_0=Ah, you need me to reconstruct this sigil? It shouldn't be too difficult... all the pieces seem to be here and the magical structure will be easy to reform.$b$bYou might want to close your eyes.

[npctext 31735]
text0_0=$N! Do you have the second sigil?

[npctext 31736]
text0_0=We're halfway to being able to remove Trol'kalar from Trollbane's tomb. We are not exactly sure where the third sigil is, as its holders seem to move around Arathi quite a bit, but I have faith that you'll be able to find it.

[npctext 31737]
text0_0=This cluster of shards looks much like the Shards of Myzrael. But the same feeling of security does not pulse through them.

[npctext 31738]
text0_0=Ah! You activated these shards. Already I feel more myself!$b$bBut alas, I am still far from free...

[npctext 31739]
text0_0=Valorcall will not be easy to track down, $N. Mounted on horseback, he can cover ground quickly. Nonetheless, we must have his sigil.

[npctext 31740]
text0_0=Losing their cavalry leader will prove a large blow to the Stromgarde defenders. Better yet, it means that we are only one sigil from being able to have Trol'kalar for ourselves.

[npctext 31741]
text0_0=You've returned, $N. Is the line of Ignaeus Trollbane broken?

[npctext 31742]
text0_0=Quite a day this is, $C. The blood of Trollbane will no longer haunt my people, and the sigils needed to take Trol'kalar are in our possession. Soon, very soon, we will strike against the hated trolls of Zul'Gurub.

[npctext 31743]
text0_0=Etchings in the stone upon the face of the tomb of Trollbane match the glowing lines of the Sigil of Ignaeus...

[npctext 31744]
text0_0=Matching the lines on the face of Trollbane's tomb with the glowing lines of the Sigil of Ignaeus, a flash of light consumes the Sigil, and the legendary sword Trol'kalar is released from the stone hands' grip.

[npctext 31745]
text0_0=$N! Have you taken the sword?

[npctext 31746]
text0_0=For generations, the forces of Strom and Arathor ravaged the trolls. Now their greatest weapon is in our hands. Our inching progress in the steamy forests of Zul'Gurub will be no more.$b$bYour assistance has been great, $N, and the Darkspear trolls are indebted to you.$b$bI will be sure that the sword is delivered to Nimboya at Grom'gol.

[npctext 31747]
text0_0=Oh, YOU'RE the great savior of OOX-17/TN! I cannot even begin to express my thanks for your assistance! My homing robot series needs more developing, but your recovery has saved me countless hours of rebuilding time, as well as many gold pieces in rebinding costs!$b$bPlease, take your choice of any of these items I have. Hopefully, you will make good use of one of them. Thank you again for your generous assistance, my robots and I are in your debt!

[npctext 31748]
text0_0=Oh yeah, about the ripple dad wants! He wants to sell the ripple to a tavern here in Orgrimmar, but we'll get more money if it is in its original packaging. I know someone who can do that, and he's in the Hinterlands where the ripple is. But he's, um, a high elf.$b$bWell, he's a good high elf, as he's not a part of the Alliance. Well, he's not so much a good high elf as he is a drunken high elf. He loves, and I mean LOVES the hooch.

[npctext 31749]
text0_0=Ah, so you know Malton? He is an old drinking companion of mine. You see, I have found something that transcends the boundaries of artificial treaties and alliances - alcohol. Were we all to slake our thirsts on its blissful qualities, we all would be in a much better place spiritually.$b$bAlas, something tells me that your visit here is not to learn of alcohol's redeeming values, now is it.

[npctext 31750]
text0_0=This is the Stone of Inner Binding. It is the strongest of the binding stones and must be unlocked for the others to open.

[npctext 31751]
text0_0=<Myzrael speaks through the stone.>$b$bYou have done it! You opened the Stones of Binding! I can feel the shackles about me loosen, and freedom draws ever closer.$b$bYou are a noble $C, $N. My rescuer!

[npctext 31752]
text0_0=The Keystone is charged with tremendous geomantic energy.

[npctext 31753]
text0_0=You place the rod in the keystone. And a shudder is felt beneath you...

[npctext 31754]
text0_0=Ah, Gor'mul you speak of. Yes, from what he says, it seems he has never recovered from the death of Doomhammer.$b$bGor'mul was a captive here when Thrall and Orgrim fought to free the camp, but as the earth shook and our brethren escaped, he was left behind. He wandered alone and lost for years without direction or hope, until we returned to establish ourselves here in Hammerfall.

[npctext 31755]
text0_0=The Shards of Myzrael are now strangely quiet.

[npctext 31756]
text0_0=As the eldritch shackles are placed around the Shards, an unhuman wail is heard from far below. The scream is followed by a roar.$b$bThe Shards of Myzrael no longer invoke feelings of warmth and security as they once did. Now they pulse with an open menace... as if the thing beneath them holds ill will toward the surface.

[npctext 31757]
text0_0=Ahoy, matey.$b$b'Twas a horrible mess. Seahorn will have my ship if he finds out what went down.$b$bOne of the Professor's contraptions indicated the lost treasure was near this cove. I brought the Harbinger in to dock and signaled for the Spirit of Silverpine and Maiden's Folly to follow suit.$b$bThen the sea rumbled. The tides lowered and the two ships crashed into the reef.$b$bIt's not just a reef. Something's down there....$b$bHelp my crew out and you'll be rewarded handsomely.

[npctext 31758]
text0_0=Nice work out there, $N.$b$bThose scum deserved what they got. While nothin' will ever bring me ship or me crew back, the death of those naga gives me some solace.

[npctext 31759]
text0_0=The goggles work perfectly now! Well done, $N.

[npctext 31760]
text0_0=How did the goggles work? Did everything function properly? Adjustments can be made if necessary.$b$bOh, and I'll need those goggles back when you're done. I am sure Captain O'Breen will have many uses for them later on.

[npctext 31761]
text0_0=Most superb, $N! The Captain will be very pleased! And just wait until word gets back to Fleetmaster Seahorn!

[npctext 31762]
text0_0=We survived the attack!$b$bWe could not have done it without you, $N.$b$bWe'll be heading out as soon as the tide rises. If you weren't such a promising hero I'd offer you a place on my crew. But I can tell you have bigger fish to fry.$b$bEven if you are a puny troll....

[npctext 31763]
text0_0=Ahoy, $C. What brings you to the bridge?

[npctext 31764]
text0_0=So the little gnomes proved their worth after all? I knew we kept those ankle biters around for a reason!

[npctext 31765]
text0_0=What brings you to Booty Bay, $C?

[npctext 31766]
text0_0=Ah, leave it to good old Shakes O'Breen! I knew that he was the right Captain for the mission!

[npctext 31767]
text0_0=So was Seahorn impressed? I bet you his smile reached from Booty Bay to Ratchet.

[npctext 31768]
text0_0=Thank you for making such a long and perilous journey. You have the gratitude of the Blackwater Raiders.

[npctext 31769]
text0_0=Once-cursed blood still runs through my veins, $N. If someone... something is summoning demons, it must be stopped.

[npctext 31770]
text0_0=It will take some time for me to ascertain the true intentions of the Syndicate, but their obvious association with dark, demonic magic troubles me. I will tell you when I know more.

[npctext 31771]
text0_0=I will create an amulet that will give Gor'mul some of the strength of the raptors. Perhaps that will awaken some flame within him...

[npctext 31772]
text0_0=Excellent. The spirits of the raptors that gave these eyes will lend strength to the bearer of this amulet.

[npctext 31773]
text0_0=The burning in my blood... it grows by the day. The $C must be stopped.

[npctext 31774]
text0_0=My restless nights will turn to peaceful slumber when I have destroyed this orb. Thank you, $N. It is a chilling reminder of the terrible power the demons held over the orcs before Hellscream released us from their curse.

[npctext 31775]
text0_0=What hope is there when the hand of a coward can slay the mightiest of the mightiest? What hope, I ask you!

[npctext 31776]
text0_0=What is this? Polished bone. What use have I for polished bone? Will a trinket restore the Horde to its glory?

[npctext 31777]
text0_0=It did not work, I see. Nonetheless, I feel that showing him the power of the shamans will eventually return Gor'mul to his once proud self. The amulet's power was not great enough to show him our newfound power.

[npctext 31778]
text0_0=So, you think you're strong enough to help Hammerfall? So be it.$b$bTallow either sent you to that ogre mound in the hopes that you would kill yourself or he thinks you're strong enough to aid us. Either way, you're here now and I am in need of more soldiers in our fight against the constant attacks.$b$bIf you plan on staying in Hammerfall then get some rest, and come speak to me again when you're ready. There's no shortage of fighting to be had.

[npctext 31779]
text0_0=The signs of war are upon your garments, and sweat drips from your brow. Good, very good indeed.

[npctext 31780]
text0_0=You are as strong as a kodo, and your lust for battle does your people proud.

[npctext 31781]
text0_0=I see your courage finally wanes. It seems my instincts were correct about you: your strength is nothing compared to your bravado.$b$bReturn to me when the beast's head has been severed, or return never again.

[npctext 31782]
text0_0=You do your people proud, $N. The threat has been greatly lessened, and I am sure we will begin to thrive here in the Highlands.

[npctext 31783]
text0_0=Near the Tower of Arathor--that is where you will find Or'Kalar. His death will stop the attacks on Hammerfall and protect my husband's life.$b$bI see in your eyes that you think me weak--even dishonorable--for my silence. Some day you will learn what it is to love as I do. Perhaps then you will understand a different kind of strength and honor.$b$bIn the meantime, do as I ask, and slay Or'Kalar.

[npctext 31784]
text0_0=You have done me a great service, $N. Know that my husband's life and the safety of Hammerfall has been protected for another day because of your deeds. Please take this as a reward for your courage.

[npctext 31785]
text0_0=Very good, $N. With the deaths of those Syndicate members we should have an easier time receiving supplies from Southshore.$b$bPerhaps our cause yet has hope.

[npctext 31786]
text0_0=Have you retrieved any Stromgarde Badges, $N? The Syndicate must learn they cannot profit from our dead.

[npctext 31787]
text0_0=Thank you, $N. We will inform the families of these fallen soldiers that they were killed in battle.$b$bIt will be grim news to bear, but it is better than the uncertainty of a missing loved one.

[npctext 31788]
text0_0=Greetings, $C. You have a report to make?

[npctext 31789]
text0_0=You took down Marez Cowl? Well done, $N. Well done indeed!$b$bMarez menaced our Stromgarde defenders, and it is rumored she was an emissary between the Syndicate and some other, darker power. We are glad to see she'll longer ply her powers against us.

[npctext 31790]
text0_0=Hello. Do you have a report to submit?

[npctext 31791]
text0_0=Falconcrest and Otto? Wonderful!$b$bHere is your reward, $N. I am happy to pay it.

[npctext 31792]
text0_0=Hello. Hello, hello hello hello hello HELLO!$b$bI'm sorry - wait, no I'm not! Don't be rude!$b$bOh no...that was crazy talk.$b$bBut...sometimes being crazy is my only solace.

[npctext 31793]
text0_0=Welcome, $C. The Lady has informed me of your coming, and if we are to bring her back to the surface then we have much to discuss...

[npctext 31794]
text0_0=So, Malin sent ye? I don't care if Muradin rose up from the dead and whisked ye here on a dragon. I'm busy! Talk to Kryten if you need somethin'.

[npctext 31795]
text0_0=Did you find those fragments?!?! You'll need the Scroll of Myzrael if you want to trap her again, before it's too late!

[npctext 31796]
text0_0=Ah, you found them! Good work, $N! These might be the only chance we have against the evil of Myzrael!$b$bJust let me find my scrap-ratchet and see if I can re-attach these fragments...

[npctext 31797]
text0_0=Pluto, hello again. Have you found an azure agate yet?

[npctext 31798]
text0_0=You amaze me, Pluto. Well done again.$b$bGive me a moment to cast the proper spell to enchant the gem, an' you'll be ready.

[npctext 31799]
text0_0=Good, good.$b$bIf there are no other delays, how about we get started?

[npctext 31800]
text0_0=You do this, an' I'm sure Malin'll be more than pleased with you.

[npctext 31801]
text0_0=Malin couldn't've asked a worthier person to come here an' aid us, Pluto. You've done a grand job!$b$bHe'll be pleased to see what an overwhelming success our mission's been.

[npctext 31802]
text0_0=Yes? You look vaguely familiar. I do apologize, but have we met? I get so busy I lose track.

[npctext 31803]
text0_0=<Archmage Malin opens the letter, and his eyes grow wide.>$b$bBy the Light, you've done it. How wonderful. Trelane will be so pleased. I'm sure Kryten and Skuerto are just as excited as I am to have them on their way back to Stormwind.$b$bThank you, Pluto. Please, take this to help you in your journeys.

[npctext 31804]
text0_0=Lok'tar, $C. Traveling through the swamps isn't a risk taken lightly. You're brave to test your mettle here.

[npctext 31805]
text0_0=Ah! Wonderful. Fresh meat for the fire tonight. Thank you, $N.$b$bYou've helped make the coming nights more tolerable. The fire burns bright, and our stomachs will be full.$b$bIts a pleasant surprise to have you bring us a shipment; Dar's not the most attractive orc anyone's laid eyes upon, but at least his attitude reeks far less than his smell.

[npctext 31806]
text0_0=Good mead, a warm fire, an army of orcs and an arsenal of weapons... that's all we really need out here along the coast. I don't regret my position out here safeguarding Stonard, but it would be nice if we could one day get a burrow, or at least a tower.

[npctext 31807]
text0_0=Glad to see you're alive and well, $N.$b$bThese claws should make do nicely. The more weapons we have at the ready for attacks against us, the better off we'll be.$b$bI'll get started on your weapon as soon as possible. It will only take a short time. I've become quite adept and quick at their production.

[npctext 31808]
text0_0=My preparations are made, all I require are the raptor hearts.

[npctext 31809]
text0_0=Yes, these will work perfectly. I will transfer their power and the spirit of the raptors into this orb. This orb will imbue Gor'mul with the fiery strength and intelligence of the raptor.

[npctext 31810]
text0_0=Returned again have you? Indeed there is nothing more I could wish for now than more of Tor'gan's pity.$b$bWhat have you for me this time? Perhaps a piece of brightly colored string? Or a length of rope to end this misery of mine...

[npctext 31811]
text0_0=At least it is something interesting you bring to me this time. A strange power it emits...

[npctext 31812]
text0_0=Hello, $N. Did you bring me my wings?

[npctext 31813]
text0_0=Ah, I'll get started on those wings right away. I can almost taste them already!$b$bAnd here's the recipe in case you want to make them yourself!

[npctext 31814]
text0_0=Did you get my pearls? I'm almost out of flash bombs!

[npctext 31815]
text0_0=These will work great! I just need to smash them into powder...then mix them with a little of this and a little of that.$b$bWatch out, scavengers! Prepare to be flashed!

[npctext 31816]
text0_0=Did you find the tablet? It must hold secrets! Secrets to save us!

[npctext 31817]
text0_0=Oh, fortune is with us! Thank you! We may yet be saved!

[npctext 31818]
text0_0=This area's perfect for-- Could you hold these in place for a moment? Yes, just like that, along the vector normal. Now, what was I... Right. Perfect for testing my latest project. The raw materials, the open space... what more could an intelligent and enlightened practitioner of the arts ask for?

[npctext 31819]
text0_0=These shall do nicely, $N. Thank you. Hmm, a bit more sand than I'd anticipated. Have to adjust the coefficient of friction. No, wait; it should still be negligible with the frost oil.$b$b<Mumbling to himself, Lotwil puts one fist into the palm of his other hand and stares at them as if fascinated.>

[npctext 31820]
text0_0=The stone slabs you found were ideal, $N. Lucien will be taking the extra ones back to Kharanos when we're done here. After all, they could prove useful again.$b$bFor instance, they'd be a nice basis for a handy little shelter once I start looking into a multidisciplinary approach to high-yield explosives...$b$b

[npctext 31821]
text0_0=$N, have you ever considered becoming a research assistant? No? I'm not sure what I'll do without your abilities here. Intelligence, curiosity, and strength--all combined into one package.

[npctext 31822]
text0_0=Have you found the oil I need? It would be so helpful if you were able to find some.

[npctext 31823]
text0_0=Stupendous! This should be the perfect coolant for my new bracers. If the enchantments don't last a century, then I'll give all my belongings to Servo.$b$bAll the mages of the Assembly will be in such awe after I finish this, $N. You just wait and see.

[npctext 31824]
text0_0=Yes, yes, yes. Just a moment.$b$b

[npctext 31825]
text0_0=HA!$b$b<Lotwil grabs the gyrochronatom from you.>$b$bPerfect... just about done. No, really. I AM almost done now. This project is my top priority... at the moment. Let me pop this into place, and you can see for yourself what you've helped me create. It'll just take me a few more minutes... maybe... possibly longer. Well, maybe a lot longer. We'll see...

[npctext 31826]
text0_0=He's getting closer to finishing. How are things going on your end?

[npctext 31827]
text0_0=YES!$b$bI mean, thank you, $N. These will be helpful while traveling through the Badlands.

[npctext 31828]
text0_0=I wouldn't wait too long to get that bracer, Orthanc.$b$bWho knows what's going to happen next?

[npctext 31829]
text0_0=Hello. Welcome to my shop, but watch what you touch.$b$bKnowledge can be deadly.

[npctext 31830]
text0_0=Oh. Greetings, brother.$b$bAnd praise to the dwellers beneath.

[npctext 31831]
text0_0=Ah, we have an eager $C, I see. Are you here to learn from my collection? Good!$b$bBut be warned: just as knowledge gives power to the strong...it will drive the weak mad.

[npctext 31832]
text0_0=Be discrete with your signs, $C. There are those who do not believe the righteousness of our pledge.$b$bAnd there are those who would see us fail if they knew of us.$b$bWe must always be careful. And watchful. And patient.

[npctext 31833]
text0_0=Hollee, is that you? I need some help chiseling this stone. Hand me my stone brush, I think I see something.$b$bHey, you're not Hollee! Don't suppose you've seen my stone brush?$b$bNever mind that now! I promised the League I'd send the mysterious fossil I found. Where did Hollee go?$b$bSo much work to be done! Now where is that mysterious fossil... and my brush... and Hollee...$b$bAnd who are you... 'tis no matter, so long as you're here to help.$b$bLet me know when you're ready to start looking.

[npctext 31834]
text0_0=Cog #5, huh? Yeah, this isn't going to be good.

[npctext 31835]
text0_0=How goes your mission, $C.

[npctext 31836]
text0_0=I am impressed! You possess great skill, or great fortune, to have gained these relics. Either way, you are an asset to us.

[npctext 31837]
text0_0=Ho! You were gone a long time. Did you get the digest?

[npctext 31838]
text0_0=You got it! Oh, hope glimmers!$b$bYour efforts may yet save us, $N. A monument they should make of you! A shrine they should build! May your name be praised until your grandchildren have grandchildren!$b$bUnless...THEY are freed and rise to the surface.  If that happens then you can forget about children.$b$bIf THEY are freed, then we're all worm food.

[npctext 31839]
text0_0=The Windfuries are deadly foes. Their strength in battle is only rivaled by their desire for fresh meat.

[npctext 31840]
text0_0=You have done well, Kowanchee. You seem well prepared to travel onward. Let the wind always be at your back.

[npctext 31841]
text0_0=This headdress will certainly be a wonderful gift for my brother.

[npctext 31842]
text0_0=Thank you for your help, Weegee.$b$bMy part in my brother's ceremony is almost complete. Giving him his headdress and witnessing the ceremony are all my duty requires of me.

[npctext 31843]
text0_0=If the Palemanes had respected the land and its inhabitants more, this conflict would have never occurred.

[npctext 31844]
text0_0=Kowanchee, it is good you've taken my task seriously. Respect of the land and its creatures is important. Death and life are a circle... a necessity. One cannot exist without the other. Take time to ponder this and do well to never forget it.

[npctext 31845]
text0_0=Hello, $N. Do you have the Broken Tools? The dwarves' digging will enrage the kodos of Mulgore. This defilement must be stopped!

[npctext 31846]
text0_0=Thank you, $N. This will calm the beasts of Mulgore. And, spirits willing, it will teach the dwarves that hollowing the land is not the path to knowledge.

[npctext 31847]
text0_0=Providing meat and feathers for the tribe is the first step in proving yourself as a $C before the Chief.

[npctext 31848]
text0_0=The $R of Narache thank you, Kowanchee. You show much promise.

[npctext 31849]
text0_0=Do you have the paws and talons, Kowanchee?

[npctext 31850]
text0_0=You have done well, Kowanchee. I will take these and bind their power into a totem of cleansing.

[npctext 31851]
text0_0=All sides of the crate are stamped with the sign of the Venture Co. Mining Division. Notes printed carefully on the side of the carton indicate that the contents are due for processing at one of their central plants.

[npctext 31852]
text0_0=If you can provide pelts for the tribe I will pass word along to my father, Chief Hawkwind, of your generous deeds.

[npctext 31853]
text0_0=The $R of Narache thank you for these provisions, Kowanchee. With your skill in the ways of the hunt you will surely be revered in Thunder Bluff someday.

[npctext 31854]
text0_0=Hail, Kowanchee. Have you learned anything new about the Venture Co.'s plans and operations in our homeland?$b$bIf they plan to exploit our lands as they have others, the Outrunners will be quick to put an end to it.

[npctext 31855]
text0_0=It does indeed appear that the Venture Co. is attempting to rob us of our natural resources. It is good to know this for true, and now it seems, we must do something about it.

[npctext 31856]
text0_0=You traveled all this way just to help an old woman? My my, aren't you a keeper?

[npctext 31857]
text0_0=You look as though you have returned from the plains. Do you have any word from Greatmother Hawkwind?

[npctext 31858]
text0_0=You carried this pitcher back at the Greatmother's bidding, I see.$b$bYour willingness to help others and provide for the tauren of Camp Narache leads me to believe you would make the tribe proud in Thunder Bluff someday.

[npctext 31859]
text0_0=News of your deed reached me moments ago -- already the beasts near the well drink from it eagerly.$b$bYou have done a great thing for the land, Kowanchee. And you have done a great thing for the Tauren people.

[npctext 31860]
text0_0=Chief Hawkwind sent you? Embarking on the Rites of the Earthmother is no small task...

[npctext 31861]
text0_0=Kowanchee, do you have the claws I sent you to gather? The Thunderhorn Water Well grows more tainted with each passing hour!

[npctext 31862]
text0_0=Thank you, Kowanchee. The purity with which these beasts hunt is vital in the creation of the next cleansing totem.$b$bThe goblins will never learn the difference between contending with the land, and living in harmony with it.

[npctext 31863]
text0_0=Have you completed the Rite of Strength, Kowanchee? I require proof of your valor against the enemy of our tribe, the Bristlebacks.

[npctext 31864]
text0_0=You have passed the first test of the Rites of the Earthmother. The tribe will be proud.

[npctext 31865]
text0_0=Ancestors of the Thunderhorn clan spoke to me in a dream, praising you for your actions near their well.$b$bFor their gratitude, they wish to give you this...

[npctext 31866]
text0_0=Kowanchee. Do you have the teeth I asked for?

[npctext 31867]
text0_0=Very good, Kowanchee. I can feel the sacrifice of the land in this offering, and my spirit swells with sadness, and pride.

[npctext 31868]
text0_0=You've done it. You have cleaned the wells, and healed our land. Bloodhoof village is grateful, Kowanchee.$b$bMay the wind whisper your deeds for a hundred seasons, and may the waters of Mulgore remain clean forever.

[npctext 31869]
text0_0=Have you found the swoops, Kowanchee. Do you have their quills?

[npctext 31870]
text0_0=I know that gathering these quills was not an easy task, Kowanchee. In doing this, you prove that you are a $C of merit. It is good to have you at Bloodhoof Village.

[npctext 31871]
text0_0=What brings you to my village, $C?

[npctext 31872]
text0_0=Word from my good friend, Chief Hawkwind! Ah, I can see by his carvings you are of a special breed.

[npctext 31873]
text0_0=I don't think there could be too much misinterpreting or ignoring of that signal, hm? The Venture Co. will know not to take the tauren lightly, or to be so arrogant as to believe we would allow them to steal the natural resources around us without protest.

[npctext 31874]
text0_0=I seethe with anger at the thought of the atrocities the Venture Co. is willing to perpetrate against us in the name of profit.

[npctext 31875]
text0_0=My anger is somewhat lessened at the news that the villain Fizsprocket is dead. I will go through his personal effects and see if there is any additional information about what the Venture Co. has planned for the future. Thank you for your efforts, $N.

[npctext 31876]
text0_0=My fever grows worse and I find my mind drifting into delirious nightmares... I should have known that I wouldn't be able to handle a beast my grandfather was unable to defeat...$b$bDo you have the ingredients for the remedy? I fear if I do not clean the infection soon, it will be the death of me.

[npctext 31877]
text0_0=Ah, thank you, Kowanchee. Using the items you brought me, I will be able to create the remedy I need to stop the spread of the infection and, eventually, cure it completely. I owe you my life in thanks.$b$bBut I'll never forget that screeching call when Mazzranache came upon me, the blaze of color as its beak descended...$b$bBe wary on your travels.

[npctext 31878]
text0_0=I sensed you would be coming to me, $C. I can always recognize one who is trying to pass the Rites of the Earthmother.

[npctext 31879]
text0_0=I can barely believe my old eyes! You defeated the great wolf Ghost Howl? I look upon you with new respect, young $C. You are a $C of extreme skills!$b$bLet me offer you something. My days of hunting are over, but I would be honored if you used one of my weapons in your hunts.$b$bMay it strike true, and bring you renown.$b$bAnd let us hope that Ghost Howl's spirit has finally found peace.

[npctext 31880]
text0_0=Once you have gathered enough well stones from around the water wells and Ambercorn from beneath the trees, I will prepare the Water of the Seers for you.

[npctext 31881]
text0_0=I see you have learned to gather from our sacred land, Kowanchee. It will take but a moment for me to brew the Water of the Seers.

[npctext 31882]
text0_0=Be not afraid, Kowanchee. You have successfully passed the Rite of Vision.

[npctext 31883]
text0_0=You have shown great diligence in your yearning to pass the Rites of the Earthmother, Kowanchee.$b$bWe, the Ancestral Spirits, represent the mighty tauren who gave their lives bravely to found and protect our great city of Thunder Bluff. I hereby pass the duty of that protection over to you.$b$bYou have passed the Rite of Wisdom, young $C. Enter Thunder Bluff with pride.

[npctext 31884]
text0_0=Hail, young $C. I see you found your way to my doorstep.

[npctext 31885]
text0_0=Have you tracked down Arra'chea yet?

[npctext 31886]
text0_0=Well done! A fine kill that was.$b$bI will send a gathering party to collect the carcass so we can retrieve the hide and meat.$b$bYou have done a great deed for your people, $N.

[npctext 31887]
text0_0=$b$bThe cog, $N, the cog!

[npctext 31888]
text0_0=Ah, perfect. Stand back while I prepare to make more history!$b$b<Lotwil continues to work feverishly.>

[npctext 31889]
text0_0=Not quite the outcome I was expecting. Could you get my shackles back?

[npctext 31890]
text0_0=Thank you, $N. That was quite an ordeal, wasn't it?$b$bI'm not sure what could have gone wrong. It was a good thing my magics were here to help send the creature back to its home plane.$b$bPerhaps a little token of appreciation for all your hard work...

[npctext 31891]
text0_0=The aggression of the Battleboars is increasing. Have you sent them a clear message and brought back some snouts and flanks yet?

[npctext 31892]
text0_0=Most excellent. These ingredients will make a fine stew and the loss of those boars should be a fair lesson to those vile Bristlebacks.

[npctext 31893]
text0_0=You have a look of concern about you, $N. What news do you bring?

[npctext 31894]
text0_0=This is quite alarming indeed! But with this information we can call on our brethren from Bloodhoof Village to help thwart the attack. You have saved the lives of many tauren, $N.

[npctext 31895]
text0_0=Tho'grun's betrayal... is there any wonder why the ogres are part of the Horde no longer? I will be glad to see him dead, and the Sign of the Earth returned.$b$bIf you've not dispatched him yet, then waste no time going to Camp Boff. It is to the southeast of Kargath.

[npctext 31896]
text0_0=With Tho'grun dead, his corpse picked clean by the desert winds and scavenging buzzards, the ogres will be put into disarray. Though a small victory, this will lead to a much larger one$b$bThe Sign of the Earth is now in our possession, and we can open the black drakes' prison in Lethlor. We shall free them from endless imprisonment, albeit to their doom!

[npctext 31897]
text0_0=Ah, good. Another volunteer. We're getting a lot of you these days.$b$bI hope it's enough.$b$bThe human lands are threatened from without, and so many of our forces have been marshaled abroad. This, in turn, leaves room for corrupt and lawless groups to thrive within our borders.$b$bIt is a many-fronted battle we wage, $N. Gird yourself for a long campaign.

[npctext 31898]
text0_0=Word of your bravery travels fast, $C. Tales of your victory at Tiragarde Keep will be heralded in Orgrimmar.

[npctext 31899]
text0_0=The centaurs have proven to be a consistent nuisance to the Horde. Their intentions to lay siege to our homeland cannot be tolerated.

[npctext 31900]
text0_0=The Horde would surely prevail if the Kolkar centaurs were to attack. But by preventing such an attack, we have spared our mighty warriors unnecessary bloodshed.$b$bAnd as sure as there is sand in the Tanaris desert, we know that there will be blood spilled before these trying times are through.$b$bYou have served your people well, $C.

[npctext 31901]
text0_0=I hope you haven't returned to try and convince me that you have completed your task, Hork? No, of course not. I would think better of you.

[npctext 31902]
text0_0=Hmmm, not bad, Borked. But don't let it get to your head...you'll fight tougher than boars in your career.$b$bNonetheless, you've proven yourself well, and your next trial will be against a considerably more dangerous opponent, so you'll need some extra protection.

[npctext 31903]
text0_0=The carapace of a scorpid isn't so thick that the strength of a determined $C will be deterred. Strike strongly and without doubt, and the scorpids should prove easy prey.

[npctext 31904]
text0_0=There is an important lesson that you must take away from fighting scorpids. The smallest or largest of opponents can still send you to your doom. In fierce combat, any number of things can prove your downfall.$b$bI have no more to teach you, Guage. You have done well, and I will watch your progress with interest.

[npctext 31905]
text0_0=Ahhh... my father always said I would never amount to much, and here, lying beneath a tree as life seeps away, I'm afraid it looks like he was right.$b$bAt least I wish to die knowing that my last enemy in life lays dead.

[npctext 31906]
text0_0=My blow was not enough to kill him, but looking at the damage I inflicted gives me some small measure of pride. That small measure will be all I have to sustain myself if I die, and in that light, the short list of my life's accomplishments fills me with anger.

[npctext 31907]
text0_0=I fought proudly alongside the Warchief when these lands were pioneered. The scars of battle mark my skin.$b$bThe honor of the Horde has been upheld with the help of my axe and battlecry during the defeat of Archimonde, when the unholy alliance was made with the humans and elves, wrought from necessity.$b$bBut my position as watchman and provider has given me a new sense of worth.

[npctext 31908]
text0_0=Most excellent, $N. Any good $C will surely find a use for this bag on the battlefield.$b$bI salute your vigor and willingness to die in the name of the Horde!

[npctext 31909]
text0_0=You have done well, $N.$b$bAlthough the Vile Familiars were merely pets of the darker powers within the Burning Blade, your success against them foretells greater deeds ahead.

[npctext 31910]
text0_0=There are few enemies more deadly than dragonkind, and there were few dragons that fought as ferociously as Blacklash and Hematus.

[npctext 31911]
text0_0=The black dragonflight continues to ally with the renegade Blackrock orcs, and both must be brought into line, or removed. With Blacklash and Hematus dead, we can turn our attentions westwards, towards Blackrock Spire.

[npctext 31912]
text0_0=Is your task complete, $N? Do you have the Burning Blade Medallion?

[npctext 31913]
text0_0=You retrieved it! Well done!$b$bYour efforts within the Burning Blade Coven are key in rooting out this cult in the Valley of Trials. But I fear they have further aims in our land.$b$bWe have not seen the end of them.

[npctext 31914]
text0_0=From your description of the beast, I believe you must be speaking of Sarkoth! It is no wonder that Hana'zua was overtaken by it. Aid will be dispatched to him immediately, trouble yourself no more with Hana'zua's plight.$b$bHowever, I must say, I am most impressed to hear that you brought Sarkoth to death. It is a feat to be proud of, $N. And that you would fight for a stranger's honor, while other tasks occupied your time, your own honor is heightened.

[npctext 31915]
text0_0=Hm... your report comes at a bad time. The Burning Blade is not seen here in Sen'jin, but their evil has taken seed off the coast, on the Echo Isles.$b$bThe orcs are friends of the Darkspear Trolls. Honorable friends. We want to help the orcs, but... we need help too.$b

[npctext 31916]
text0_0=Did you find Fizzle, Mujoboa? He, and and rest of the Burning Blade, must be scoured from our lands!

[npctext 31917]
text0_0=Aha! You got him!$b$bYou do your clan proud, Mujoboa. And because of you, Durotar is free of one more agent of evil.

[npctext 31918]
text0_0=Do you have my brother's skull, Weegee? Is he finally free?

[npctext 31919]
text0_0=Thank you, Weegee. You have saved Minshina. You have saved my brother's spirit from slavery!

[npctext 31920]
text0_0=Neeru wants the Demon Seed destroyed, does he? Strange...$b$bVery well. If he wishes the seed gone, then I will tell you how to remove it.

[npctext 31921]
text0_0=Breakfast, lunch, dinner! Who cares which meal it is? It still has to be cooked by someone--namely me!

[npctext 31922]
text0_0=You might be weak, but at least you're not clumsy, Weegee.$b$bHere, take this and get outta my way. I've got cooking to do.

[npctext 31923]
text0_0=I pray that Kron will return to me, but I'm almost certain I know his fate already.

[npctext 31924]
text0_0=Oh, my son... my beautiful son.$b$bUncertain of my son's fate, I have tormented myself since he left. Now that I know what's happened, perhaps I can finally begin to mourn.$b$bThank you, Weir. Please take this. I was going to give it to Kron as a gift when he returned successful. Now that I know he is dead, I cannot bear to look at it.

[npctext 31925]
text0_0=I remember my first tiger hunt, Weegee. I chose to hunt on the largest of the Echo Isles, and I sat perfectly still in the shadows of its foliage for almost a full day... watching... waiting.$b$bMy muscles were taut, and I was ready to strike. It was one of my greatest victories when that tiger finally took the bait.

[npctext 31926]
text0_0=I am pleased, Weegee. Because of your help, our people will be protected, and not go cold as the seasons change.$b$bThank you.

[npctext 31927]
text0_0=Time is the true test of your strength and will. Lose patience or give in to weakness, and your true self will be shown.

[npctext 31928]
text0_0=Well done, young one... well done indeed.

[npctext 31929]
text0_0=Yes? You have something to report? Well then, let's have it!

[npctext 31930]
text0_0=Ah, hello there. I spend a great deal of time studying the water - all the elements really - so much so that sometimes I don't even notice people around me.$b$bIs there something I can help you with?

[npctext 31931]
text0_0=This globe... it is most disturbing. Many of the more powerful elementals receive their power and energy through such devices. To find one like this nearly intact is one thing - to find it so tainted is another.$b$bI will see that this globe is studied properly by the Earthen Ring. Perhaps we can bring an end to this corruption of the elements. Please - accept this as a fair exchange for bringing this globe to the attention of the Earthen Ring.

[npctext 31932]
text0_0=Once we learn how the humans operate their strange machinery, we will stand a greater chance of defeating them in future battles.$b$bWith our new gained knowledge, the Horde only stands to grow in strength.

[npctext 31933]
text0_0=Your recovery mission was a success, $C. I will see to it that these tools get to Orgrimmar with the next caravan.$b$bNicely done.

[npctext 31934]
text0_0=Is Zalazane defeated, Weegee?

[npctext 31935]
text0_0=With Zalazane gone, our tribe can again sleep in peace.$b$bThank you, Weegee. The Darkspear tribe owes you much. If you suffer from an ailment, visit my assistant Bom'bay, behind me. His voodoo is strong...

[npctext 31936]
text0_0=Have you yet entered Skull Rock, $N? Do you have the Searing Collars?

[npctext 31937]
text0_0=Good. Hiding within these collars is the secret behind the Burning Blade. And I will uncover that secret...

[npctext 31938]
text0_0=Welcome, $N. Word reached me of your coming, and of your exploits in Durotar.$b$bYou are a $C of growing skill and renown.$b$bStay on the pure path, and your future will be great indeed.

[npctext 31939]
text0_0=My most humble greetings, $C. How might I help my $R brother today?

[npctext 31940]
text0_0=Ah, and where did you get this? Good Margoz in Razor Hill sent you to me, did he?$b$bWell, let me take a closer look...

[npctext 31941]
text0_0=There is a look of concern on your face, $C. What have you there?

[npctext 31942]
text0_0=This does not bode well at all. You were wise to bring this information to my attention.

[npctext 31943]
text0_0=Can you not see that I am busy? This had better be pressing....

[npctext 31944]
text0_0=Countless times I urged the Warchief not to trust the humans, but personal pride is not what is at stake here.$b$bYou have served the Horde honorably, young $C.$b$bNow excuse me, I must counsel Thrall on these matters at once....

[npctext 31945]
text0_0=You have something vital to report. I can sense it behind your eyes.

[npctext 31946]
text0_0=<Examines the Eye of Burning Shadow>$b$bIntriguing. The voice you heard mentioned my name? I am known for hunting down enemies of our Warchief, but...it is strange that I was singled out. Stranger still that the Burning Blade cultists from whom you recovered this pendant have a name so close to my own.$b$bI must study this pendant. I must study and, and must ponder the meaning of its message.$b$bThank you for bringing this to my attention, $N. You have done your people a great service.

[npctext 31947]
text0_0=Well done. You have sent those foul Bristlebacks a clear message. They will think twice before attempting to meddle in this holy spot again.

[npctext 31948]
text0_0=I'm great at what I do, don't get me wrong, but this is ridiculous! What am I supposed to do, build sand castles?

[npctext 31949]
text0_0=Hey, now isn't that just the thing! You've got our supplies back for us. That's great. I'll be able to get back to work just as soon as I can find someone to haul these sacks for me.

[npctext 31950]
text0_0=I think I can breathe easy now, knowing that the harpies won't be bothering our supply caravans anymore. And not one moment too soon, either. I hear I'm being sent some fun little toys with the next shipment!$b$bYou're pretty good at what you do, Mujoboa, you ought to track down my boss in Ratchet. I'll bet he could find some work for you.$b$bOh, and don't worry, I wouldn't forget to pay you for the service you provided me.

[npctext 31951]
text0_0=Oh, YOU'RE the great savior of OOX-09/HL! I cannot even begin to express my thanks for your assistance! My homing robot series needs more development, but your recovery has saved me countless hours of extra rebuilding time, as well as many gold pieces in manufacture costs!$b$bPlease, take your choice of any of these items I have. Thank you again for your generous assistance $N, my robots and I are in your debt!

[npctext 31952]
text0_0=Though they do possess some intelligence and some organization, I find it constantly amazing that the quilboars were able to capture and hold so much territory in Kalimdor. Perhaps they are more crafty an enemy than I give them credit for...

[npctext 31953]
text0_0=I will pass along word that the quilboars have been removed from their lairs, and that their structures may be set to fire. The removal of the Razormane from Durotar brings us closer to fully securing the borders of our new homeland.

[npctext 31954]
text0_0=Yes, $C, the High Executor mentioned you might be the one to trust in the matter of they key. I've dedicated a fair portion of my recent studies to the Scholomance, and I believe I know a means by which you can acquire one that will let you past the front door at will.$b$bThis task will not be easy, but such tasks seldom are. You most assuredly look like the type to know this as fact.

[npctext 31955]
text0_0=What do you want, pup? If you're not here for recruitment, I don't have time for you.

[npctext 31956]
text0_0=Oh, so Takrin sent you? He's an excellent scout, I'm not sure what I'd do without him.$b$bI'll sign your recruitment letter, but what we really need is someone at the Crossroads.

[npctext 31957]
text0_0=Well well well, what do we have here? Has Kargal deemed me worthy of another recruit?

[npctext 31958]
text0_0=Alright, $N. You want to earn your keep with the Horde? Well there's plenty to do here, so listen close and do what you're told.$b$b I see that look in your eyes, do not think I will tolerate any insolence. Thrall himself has declared the Hordes females to be on equal footing with you men. Disrespect me in the slightest, and you will know true pain.

[npctext 31959]
text0_0=When the enchantment wears off, I will speak with Gor'mul. My thanks to you for your help in returning Gor'mul to the land of the living. I have no doubt he thanks you greatly as well.

[npctext 31960]
text0_0=It is good to see that more of our $R allies have come to assist us from as far away as Thunder Bluff. Again, I welcome you.

[npctext 31961]
text0_0=You want to hunt in the Barrens?$b$bYour eyes are eager, and young. They're not yet squinted from tracking your prey across this land's dry plains.$b$bBut worry not. We'll toughen your body and your mind. And we'll teach you that there is more to hunting than finding and killing your quarry.$b$bPrepare yourself. Your journey begins. Now.

[npctext 31962]
text0_0=Greetings. There is an air about you that tells me much. Do we have business, you and I?

[npctext 31963]
text0_0=Skorn Whitecloud is a wise tauren. He has hunted for years and years, and although his body is old, his spirit burns fiercely. We are honored to have him with us.$b$bIf Skorn sent you to me, then you too must have the $C's spirit. And to have gathered these claws shows your burgeoning skills.$b$bPerhaps you are ready to walk the path.

[npctext 31964]
text0_0=The longer it takes to stop these attacks, the harder it will be to provide supplies for the people of the Crossroads.

[npctext 31965]
text0_0=You have done well, $N. Those insolent quilboars will finally learn that the might of the Horde is not to be ignored.

[npctext 31966]
text0_0=Cut off the head of their leader, and chaos ensues, $N. Learn this lesson well. It will aid you in the future.$b$bThe boars will flounder without direction, and we will be able to take back the Barrens.

[npctext 31967]
text0_0=Well done, $N. With Kreenig's death, there will be a definite decline in the attacks on our caravans.$b$bYour people should be proud to count you among them.

[npctext 31968]
text0_0=Have you been successful in locating the fathom core? Without it we'll have no idea what the Twilight's Hammer is exactly up to down there.

[npctext 31969]
text0_0=This is exactly what I need! A fathom core is an incredible well of information that we will be able to draw much good from. Whatever the Twilight's Hammer is up to in there - and believe me when I say it is no good - my comrades and I will now uncover.$b$bYou've done well here today; the Earthen Ring looks upon you warmly for assisting us. You've also helped the Horde as a whole, and for that you should be proud.

[npctext 31970]
text0_0=Ah, hello again $N. I was just reading the waves the sea, much like I always do. What brings you to the outpost?

[npctext 31971]
text0_0=This... this is quite the find, $N.$b$bYou acquired this from Baron Aquanis in Blackfathom, you say? Baron Aquanis has long been thought of as a corrupted elemental power; this globe will prove what exactly had corrupted him. While it would be no surprise if it turned out to be the Twilight's Hammer, our studies will also show how they did it as well.$b$bYou did well in bringing this to me. Please - take this, along with the Earthen Ring's warmest regards.

[npctext 31972]
text0_0=Memories of my nightmares haunt me, $N. Have you defeated the leaders of the fang and acquired their gems?

[npctext 31973]
text0_0=You have done it, $N. You killed the leaders of the Druids of the Fang. My dreams are now free of their wicked faces, and you have helped save the Barrens from a cursed future.$b$bI thank you, $N. I thank you for myself, for the druids of Thunder Bluff, and for the land.

[npctext 31974]
text0_0=Did you gather the venom sacs, $N?

[npctext 31975]
text0_0=Thank you, $N. When I return to Darnassus I will compare the venom within these sacs with the venom of other spiders. It is my belief that it will have properties linked to the recent growth of our new world tree.

[npctext 31976]
text0_0=Have you been inside the Shadowthread Cave, $N? Did you find a spider egg?

[npctext 31977]
text0_0=Ah, very good. I will have this egg and the venom transported to Darnassus, then return there when my studies are done here. I expect to find out a great deal from these specimens, $N. You have been a great help to me.

[npctext 31978]
text0_0=Do you have the seeds? I am eager to plant them.

[npctext 31979]
text0_0=You got them. This is good!$b$bI will plant these seeds in special soil I have prepared. I believe the seeds will sprout into timberlings who are much more docile. Perhaps later you can see the results!

[npctext 31980]
text0_0=Hello, $N. Have you found any sprouts near the waters?

[npctext 31981]
text0_0=That's a lot! I'm afraid they're spreading at a dangerous rate. I hope I can solve the riddle of what is tainting them.$b$bThank you for your help, $N. The land is a cleaner place from your efforts.

[npctext 31982]
text0_0=Ah, $N. I was hoping you'd be prompt in answering my summons. I have an important task that I would like you to perform.

[npctext 31983]
text0_0=The moonwells hold the waters of the Well of Eternity, the ancient source of magic that has wrought so many horrors upon our world.$b$bThe druids take advantage of its properties, and the Sentinels revere the wells as shrines to Elune, but sorcery is forbidden to all.

[npctext 31984]
text0_0=So you have heard the first part of the aftermath of the Battle of Mount Hyjal. There is much more to be told and the task you have begun here will continue through the rest of your journey through Teldrassil and into Darnassus.

[npctext 31985]
text0_0=Hello...$b$bAnd how may I help you?

[npctext 31986]
text0_0=Ah, a timberling seed? I wanted to try growing one of these to help Denalan with his studies.$b$bBut I'm afraid I've discovered that a corruption has grown in many of the timberlings, and seeds from such creatures carry their parent's taint. They are beyond my talents to repair.$b$bDenalan is very skilled with things that grow. He may find a cure for future timberlings. He may be their only hope.

[npctext 31987]
text0_0=Have you been to Wellspring Lake, $N? Have you been hunting the timberlings there?

[npctext 31988]
text0_0=Well done! These tumors are the symptom of the timberling's disease. They are filled with a poison that we must cleanse from our new land.$b$bI will dispose of these tumors. Thank you, $N.

[npctext 31989]
text0_0=The Demon Seed still exists. I can sense its power...

[npctext 31990]
text0_0=Your task is complete. You have destroyed the Demon Seed as Neeru bid. But this is not the end...$b$bThe destruction of the Demon Seed sent waves of power through the ether, waves of staggering force. I felt them, and I am sure other beings did as well. Others who will wonder why their toy was broken...$b$bBut regardless of future troubles, I have something for you. Neeru sent it as payment. And he bid me thank you.$b$bSo, thank you.

[npctext 31991]
text0_0=$N! You have something for me?

[npctext 31992]
text0_0=...What is this? A timberling heart?? It's covered with a foul moss!$b$bThank you for bringing this to me, $N. I will examine the heart and, if fortune shines, determine the nature of the moss about it.

[npctext 31993]
text0_0=Greetings, $C. For what purpose do I owe the pleasure of our meeting?

[npctext 31994]
text0_0=Ah, I see. You were sent by Tenaron. Well then, it would seem we have much to talk about, much to do, and little time to do it in.$b$bI think we'd best get started.

[npctext 31995]
text0_0=Hello again, $N. Have you completed your task?

[npctext 31996]
text0_0=After the Battle of Mount Hyjal, we were without direction. Nordrassil smoked from the fire it unleashed, and our immortality--the very essence of our beings!--was lost.$b$bIt was in this trying time that the Betrayer was freed from his prison, and Shan'do Stormrage disappeared. A dark time for all.

[npctext 31997]
text0_0=$N, you look like you have something to tell me. Do you have news concerning the timberlings?

[npctext 31998]
text0_0=You found this on Teldrassil? Intriguing... this fruit is exotic. Perhaps its seeds were brought here from far off. Perhaps even as far as Azeroth! And there's something about this fruit... it seems to have reacted very strangely with the soil of Teldrassil.$b$bThank you, $N. Now if you'll excuse me, I must study this further...

[npctext 31999]
text0_0=Vous avez quelque chose pour moi ?

[npctext 32000]
text0_0=Where did you get this? I haven't seen a plant like this since a sojourn I made to the Swamp of Sorrows... decades ago! It's amazing that a specimen made its way to Teldrassil. And it's grown to such a size!$b$bThank you, $N. Forgive my shortness of words, but there is a test I would like to perform on this frond...

[npctext 32001]
text0_0=Did you kill Lord Melenas yet? It is vital that he be taken care of quickly and quietly, $N. His continued existence is an embarrassment to us all.

[npctext 32002]
text0_0=With Lord Melenas laid to rest I can finally move on to other matters. Thank you, $N.

[npctext 32003]
text0_0=At first the reports of crazed furbolg attacks were dismissed. Who could have thought that the peace-loving bear-men would turn to mindless rage? Yet another of the problems that plagues us here in our new home.

[npctext 32004]
text0_0=Shan'do Stormrage never returned, and the druids were in disarray, and to this day we still do not know what became of him. With Malfurion missing, Arch $C Fandral Staghelm took over the leadership of the druids, convincing the Circle of Ancients in Darkshore that it was time for our people to rebuild, and that it was time for our people to regain their immortality.$b$bWith the approval of the Circle, Staghelm and the most powerful druids grew Teldrassil, the new World Tree.

[npctext 32005]
text0_0=Along with the druids, the Oracle Tree and the Arch $C have been carefully monitoring the growth of Teldrassil. But though we have a new home, our immortal lives have not been restored.

[npctext 32006]
text0_0=To be in the presence of the Oracle Tree... it is almost to feel wisdom take form. Let me continue the telling...$b$bWith Teldrassil grown, the Arch $C approached the dragons for their blessings, as the dragons had placed upon Nordrassil in ancient times. But Nozdormu, Lord of Time, refused to give his blessing, chiding the $C for his arrogance. In agreement with Nozdormu, Alexstrasza also refused Staghelm, and without her blessing, Teldrassil's growth has been flawed and unpredictable...

[npctext 32007]
text0_0=I know that I did not summon you, so I cannot help but wonder why it is you have come to speak with me.$b$bWhatever it is, please make it quick.

[npctext 32008]
text0_0=Ah yes, the water I had requested. Tenaron and Corithras certainly took their time in having it delivered... perhaps not choosing the most reliable of messengers... hmm.$b$bNonetheless, I can finally get back to my work then. The weight of Teldrassil's problems fall upon my shoulders. A yoke I would wish to soon be rid of.$b$bTake this, you may find some use for it.

[npctext 32009]
text0_0=Their slashing talons and piercing beaks may prove a difficult match for your own abilities, $N, but I have faith that you will not fail in this task.

[npctext 32010]
text0_0=I am impressed by what you have accomplished here in so short a time, $N. Would that I could ask you to remain here to assist me with my duties... but I know in my heart that greater tasks lie ahead for you.$b$bI have noticed the Oracle Tree has just shed a piece of its bark. No doubt it has a task that it wishes completed. You should speak with it.

[npctext 32011]
text0_0=Mist... It was my fault! The witches caught me off guard... I should not have let them take you...

[npctext 32012]
text0_0=Oh, thank you, $N! I feared I would never see Mist again, knowing only her death in my heart, never to be united with my faithful companion. I owe you more than you can know, and you have my eternal gratitude.

[npctext 32013]
text0_0=Hmm... You come with the spirit of the forest strongly within you, $C. What business do you have with the Arch $C of the Kaldorei?

[npctext 32014]
text0_0=I wondered why the Oracle Tree had not communicated with me for so long... It seems that some problems are lessened while others grow to greater concerns.$b$bI fear my work on Teldrassil shall never be completed, and our immortality never restored.$b$bNonetheless, you have done the Oracle Tree's task well, and should be rewarded for your diligence.

[npctext 32015]
text0_0=This planter is filled with soil, specially prepared by Denalan.

[npctext 32016]
text0_0=You place the heart within the planter, and it quickly digs itself in!$b$bA few seconds later it wriggles back out, cleansed. It pulses slightly... beckoning for you to take it.

[npctext 32017]
text0_0=The Twilight's Hammer is at the Master's Glaive?$b$bUnfortunate.$b$bThe old lord impaled by the glaive is long dead, but that does not mean slivers of his power do not still remain.$b$bThe Twilight's Hammer must be seeking this power.

[npctext 32018]
text0_0=Do you have my mushrooms, $N? Have you been to the cave?

[npctext 32019]
text0_0=Many thanks, $N. These mushrooms are fine specimens!$b$bAnd when you were at Cliffspring Falls, did you find anything to confirm the warnings of the Ancients?$b$bThe Ancients are wise, but I had hoped that, this time, they were wrong.

[npctext 32020]
text0_0=$N. You are here.$b$bGood.$b$bWe have matters...to discuss. You and I.

[npctext 32021]
text0_0=This book is hand printed in an ancient language, and illustrated by a master artist.

[npctext 32022]
text0_0=$N. You return.

[npctext 32023]
text0_0=A chaotic, primal magic surrounds this parchment of scribbles. I sense the work of the old ones in it.$b$bLet us hope it reveals the purpose of the Twilight's Hammer in Darkshore...

[npctext 32024]
text0_0=$N. Has your rooting through the Ruins of Mathystra been fruitful?

[npctext 32025]
text0_0=Thank you. These relics are from a time when Mathystra shone. That once great bastion of the elves has faded, but shards of its magic remain. Let us hope we can unlock the secrets of that place before our enemies...$b$bBe vigilant, $N.

[npctext 32026]
text0_0=Ah. $C. How may Onu assist you?

[npctext 32027]
text0_0=Ah. Thank you, $N. It is strange, though. The Arch $C always seems in such a hurry. The forest knows that all shall come to pass in the appointed time. Shan'do Stormrage understood that.

[npctext 32028]
text0_0=We have few records from the time around the War of the Ancients, especially near the destruction of the Well of Eternity. Given the upheaval and cataclysmic events that were taking place, it is no big surprise.$b$bThank you, $N. With your help, my work here is finished, and I will be able to deliver a full report to the Circle.

[npctext 32029]
text0_0=Ahh... To what could I possibly owe the exceedingly special honor of a $R such as yourself as company. Truly it says much of my current companions--with no offense to my hosts, the noble grells and satyrs--that your presence could be considered an improvement.$b$bBut please, do not let my uncivil tongue drive you from the place. It has indeed been many years, decades even, since I had civil accompaniment.

[npctext 32030]
text0_0=If only the tools of their undoing could have been destroyed in the cataclysm that destroyed our world... Nonetheless, we must do what we can to ensure that the horrors of our past are not repeated in the future.

[npctext 32031]
text0_0=Though it is surely a figment of my imagination, I feel as though I can almost feel the taint of foul Highborne magic upon them. I will have these destroyed, so that their long dormant evil might never be released again.

[npctext 32032]
text0_0=I am eager to see if you can gather enough Serpentbloom from the Wailing Caverns. I've sent many to do my bidding but none have returned.

[npctext 32033]
text0_0=Ah, splendid specimens. You have done well, $N.

[npctext 32034]
text0_0=With a great sorrow in my heart, I followed the Shan'do Stormrage into hibernation, and took my sorrow to my dreams, sleeping for the passing of thousands of years.

[npctext 32035]
text0_0=Thank you, $N. Perhaps it would have been better... if I had done it myself. But even after these thousands of years, I could not bear to raise my hand against my beloved.$b$bPlease, I would be alone with my grief...

[npctext 32036]
text0_0=Kill many and kill often, $C - we'll need a decent supply of suitable skeletal fragments to make up the outer layer of the key. They don't call it a Skeleton Key for nothing, you know.

[npctext 32037]
text0_0=This'll work, $N! My turn now - I will imbue these with a suitable temper that will allow them to survive the intense forging process they will eventually go through.$b$bThe next step will be to get an appropriate mold for the key. I know a goblin blacksmith in Tanaris that has in the past made molds for similarly macabre items. He works for whom goblins usually work for - the highest bidder.

[npctext 32038]
text0_0=Elissa sent you? Then it is good tidings you bring. I have troubling news to report to her, and had no means with which to deliver it.

[npctext 32039]
text0_0=Bring back da shards, and I be tellin' you more!

[npctext 32040]
text0_0=Ahh, yes... I will make da charm for ya now. Just you wait!

[npctext 32041]
text0_0=I'd go there myself, but... I'm a little scared of the fire elementals there!

[npctext 32042]
text0_0=Yes, I definitely see the correlation here between the temperature of the volcano and the hot springs. I'll have to double-check my equations for accuracy, but it seems like the distance and the rate that the heat is transferred... Hmm...

[npctext 32043]
text0_0=Here it is, $N. Remember, ya have ta carry it with you. Why don't ya head back to Winterspring, an' see what ya be findin' there?

[npctext 32044]
text0_0=I've just about finished attaching the fur, $N. Please, hurry back with those horns!

[npctext 32045]
text0_0=I can't wait to show my friends! Now, just wait a moment while I attach these...$b$bPerfect!

[npctext 32046]
text0_0=Hi there, $N. Yes, what Krakle told you is true...

[npctext 32047]
text0_0=The captains of those ships were good night elves, and they deserve a better fate than they were given. Perhaps tending to their personal effects will be the best way to put their spirits to rest.

[npctext 32048]
text0_0=You've done us here in Auberdine a great service, lad. We'll make sure that their effects are properly taken care of.$b$bAs for you, please have this. It is the least I can do for someone with the bravery to set things right.

[npctext 32049]
text0_0=Buzzbox 827 sits with an eerie silence. A single flashing light indicates that it needs 6 Crawler Legs to be placed in its holding box.

[npctext 32050]
text0_0=As you place the Crawler Legs inside the machine, you hear gears begin to grind. Judging from the banging sounds coming from the Buzzbox, you believe the Crawler Legs are being put in their proper place. Soon the machine begins to hum, and you hear a tiny voice calling out from within.$b$b"Hello? Uhh... Hello! You fixed it! This is Wizbang by the way! Thanks a lot... Hey, you wouldn't want to fix another one, would ya?"

[npctext 32051]
text0_0=How goes your search, Snowdogchar?

[npctext 32052]
text0_0=This is terrible news indeed, $N.$b$bWith the furbolgs this close to Auberdine, we will have to prepare ourselves for the inevitable.$b$bThank you, $N.

[npctext 32053]
text0_0=Welcome back, Junior Surveyor $N! Have you completed your assignment yet?

[npctext 32054]
text0_0=What's this? You were ambushed by some sort of bad mojo creepy-crawly? Oh, this does not bode well for the Gadgetzan Water Company, no indeed...$b$bI guess I should have told you about the reports coming in on some crazy bug-creatures that appear to be sucking up all the water in the desert. At first, I thought it was just a crock. We have enough trouble with the nomads as is; I thought it was just more of their shenanigans. Well, now we know at least!

[npctext 32055]
text0_0=Wonderful! Terenthis found someone to help me.$b$bAnd look, a moonstalker cloak...<cough> Oh... that hurts. Thank you, $N.$b$bThe furbolgs wounded me before I managed to evade them. Give me a moment, and I should be fine to talk some more.

[npctext 32056]
text0_0=$N! I'm pleased to see you've returned successfully. Your assistance to Volcor has given me faith that we can overcome the challenges facing us here in Darkshore and beyond.

[npctext 32057]
text0_0=$N! I'm pleased to see you've returned successfully. Your assistance to Volcor has given me faith that we can overcome the challenges facing us here in Darkshore and beyond.

[npctext 32058]
text0_0=You have something for me?

[npctext 32059]
text0_0=Ah, it's here! I have waited for this rare earth for quite some time. I hope it's still fresh...$b$bThank you for bringing it to me, $N. You are a $R who is generous with his time.

[npctext 32060]
text0_0=Greetings, $C.$b$bI am pleased to see the likes of you taking an interest in the well being of nature; tales of your mighty deeds precede you, and you are welcomed here. Seeing you before me instills the feeling of confidence that the Cenarion Circle will get the proper aid it needs.$b$bOur connection with the Cenarion Circle in Moonglade transcends racial and political divides. Remember this as you work on behalf of the Circle, and you will do well.

[npctext 32061]
text0_0=The machine's hatch is open and it seems to wait expectantly for 3 Thresher Eyes to be placed inside.

[npctext 32062]
text0_0=The Buzzbox hums to life soon after you place the Thresher Eyes inside. There is a moment of static before you hear a familiar tiny voice call out.$b$b"Crawler wine is the best..." *hic*$b$b"What? Oh, you fixed it already? Wow, you're a fasht one. Sho, would ya like to fix another?"$b$bYou believe you hear a liquid being poured into a cup, followed by loud gulping sounds.

[npctext 32063]
text0_0=Though you have yet to place the 6 Moonstalker Fangs inside, you believe you hear the sounds of static and incoherent gnome ramblings coming from within. Could someone else have fixed the machine already?

[npctext 32064]
text0_0=The Buzzbox suddenly leaps into action, and you can hear the distinct sounds of teeth being ground to dust coming from within.$b$b"Sho, ya made it! Thatsh exshellent newsh... Sho... Why doncha move along? Oh! Unless you want another job!"

[npctext 32065]
text0_0=You hear singing coming from Buzzbox 525.$b$b"Though crawler wine's shweet, and thresher ale fine, and moonstalker moonshine ish grand. There's nothing sho dear, as a thistle bear beer, and shoon I shall have shome on hand!"$b$bThe hatch is open and awaits the 4 grizzled scalps as you hear the song repeated over and over.

[npctext 32066]
text0_0="Sho yash gotsh the scalps in? That'sh sho great... Wha? Well, yesh I shuppose ya have realized that I can speaksh to ya without the materials in the machine. But I was telling the truth when I shaid they were broken!$b$bSee, in addition to being communimacation toolsh, the Buzzboxes also brew and distill fine liquor. Shorry for any deceptshion, but the nightelves do not apprecimerate my liquor trade in their townsh. I put shomething special in thish box to show my gratitude for yer effortsh. Enjoy!"

[npctext 32067]
text0_0=With Arugal's death we stand to increase the Dark Lady's stronghold on Lordaeron.

[npctext 32068]
text0_0=Silverpine Forest is finally free from the vice of that wretch Arugal. You have done the Dark Lady a great service, $N. Your tenacity shall be rewarded.

[npctext 32069]
text0_0=I must apologize, for I have no time to speak. My child, Relara, is deathly ill!

[npctext 32070]
text0_0=This is from Orendil?$b$bHis skill with herbs and healing is great. This cure gives me hope, when before I had little...

[npctext 32071]
text0_0=You have served the Dark Lady well, $C. 'Twas no small task I asked of you.$b$bYour loyalty to the Forsaken has been noted. And your tenacity in combat will be remembered.

[npctext 32072]
text0_0=Cairne is a brave and noble leader and I would trust him with my own life. But it is others that I do not trust in this political climate.$b$bOnce I have a chance to gather all the knowledge available I can provide sound council to the Chieftain.$b$bHave you had a chance to travel to Tirisfal Glades? To the Scarlet Monastery? The Compendium of the Fallen is just one piece in this complicated puzzle...

[npctext 32073]
text0_0=The Compendium of the Fallen! I was beginning to wonder if the very book existed!$b$bYou have served the Tauren of Thunder Bluff well, $N. Your dedication shall not be forgotten.

[npctext 32074]
text0_0=What do you want, stranger?

[npctext 32075]
text0_0=Vorrel led such a troubled existence. And what a good mate he was...$b$bDamn those filthy humans!$b$bVorrel is gone, never to enjoy undeath again. At least I can take solace in the revenge you took in his name. For that I thank you.$b$bNow let me be to mourn....

[npctext 32076]
text0_0=Look at our poor little elf friends. All caged up with no forest to frolic in!$b$bNow were you able to find me some sap? How about the whiskers from the twilight runners? Don't suppose you have that fey dragon scale on you?$b$bAnd eyes! I'll need so many eyes! You just can't mix up a fierce forest magic brew without a good helping of eyes!

[npctext 32077]
text0_0=You seem a shady character. You have something for me to see?

[npctext 32078]
text0_0=Ahh, a letter from Darsok. I have not heard from him in many years.$b$bSo the last of the Bloodfeathers are dead, eh? That is good news, I can remember when my friend Rokhan went with that crazy mok'nathal to kill her older sister. Ah, to be young again, like you.

[npctext 32079]
text0_0=Ah, a $C. Very good. We will need your skills to deal with these plunderers!

[npctext 32080]
text0_0=The Greatwood Vale lies to the northwest, $N. Go. Strike fear into those who would pillage this land!

[npctext 32081]
text0_0=Bravely done, $N.$b$bWe may ultimately need the wisdom of tauren elders to calm the spirits of Stonetalon, but...$b$bRidding the Venture Company of its personnel is a good first move against them.

[npctext 32082]
text0_0=I bid you greetings. You are here seeking council?

[npctext 32083]
text0_0=Magatha sent word of your coming, $N. Although my heart beats no longer, I still feel sorrow for the spirits of Stonetalon.$b$bThe Forsaken are eager to offer what help we can.

[npctext 32084]
text0_0=Ah, are you here with my new test subjects?

[npctext 32085]
text0_0=A note from Zamah? Her needs must be great to send word from so far. Let us see what she says...$b$bAh, splendid! I know exactly what to do!

[npctext 32086]
text0_0=Did you find the Syndicate Shadow Mages, and collect from them the bl

[npctext 32087]
text0_0=The destruction of the machines XT:4 and XT:9 have soothed many of the spirits of Stonetalon, $N. With their loss, let us hope the Venture Company will remove itself from these mountains.$b$bFor if they do not, then I fear the atrocities this place has suffered will pale to what lies ahead.

[npctext 32088]
text0_0=Here, channeling magic is like drawing water from a well with a bucket full of holes.

[npctext 32089]
text0_0=Already I can feel it... yes... power so sweet... the rushing flood. The kaldorei are foolish to spurn the gifts of this world, to reject the coursing of magic as it flows singing through your veins.$b$bWhat a pale mockery life is without its burning embrace!

[npctext 32090]
text0_0=When my master bade me to the peak of Stonetalon, I expected that all I would need was to lay waste to the night elves that crawled the sacred ruins of our ancient temple of Azshara, their touch despoiling its sanctity... but Ordanus had slipped my grasp.

[npctext 32091]
text0_0=I knew Ordanus once, long ago. He had the arrogance of his kind, holding himself above even the Highborne.$b$bHis head does not rise so high now, does it, $N?$b$bI promised you a reward, and you shall have it. Attend to me.

[npctext 32092]
text0_0=Three keyholes are carved into the stone.

[npctext 32093]
text0_0=As the three keys are slid into their matching openings, in the middle of the glowing light a number of items appear.

[npctext 32094]
text0_0=Thanks, $N. It was looking a little dicey there for a second and we've probably drawn far too much attention to ourselves.$b$bThe important part is that we have the ore sample, though, and we should get it to Ziz as soon as possible.

[npctext 32095]
text0_0=Something I can help you with?

[npctext 32096]
text0_0=Ahhh, I knew that I did the right thing by telling Piznik to stay behind. I'm sure the engineers in Undermine will be most interested to look at this...$b$bOf course I'll want to keep a little piece for myself, but what they don't know won't hurt them, yes?

[npctext 32097]
text0_0=Did you find those plans? I'm eager to impress the new boss. Hopefully, once he's convinced of my loyalty--well, as much as he can be convinced... goblin's honor, you know?--he'll feel comfortable making use of my rather impressive genius.

[npctext 32098]
text0_0=Hey, is that what I think it is? Great!$b$bNow, let's see. Ugh... how am I supposed to understand this stuff... can't figure out the way gnomes think. Lemme tell you, I'm surprised they could build the wheel, let alone those flying machines they like so much.

[npctext 32099]
text0_0=Hello there! How can I help you?

[npctext 32100]
text0_0=Fizziks, eh? Can't say I trust him, but this information seems good enough. What I wouldn't give to have the Venture Company out of my hair.$b$bThey do come up with some good machines though... I can't deny that we've benefited from using some of the improvements they've devised.

[npctext 32101]
text0_0=Eliminate Gerenzo? Now there is a prospect that I have no objections to.$b$bGnomes are bad enough as it is, but what I learned about Gerenzo only makes it worse. Apparently, he was one of the head engineers in Gnomeregan, where he was working on their secret project--we could never infiltrate Dun Morogh well enough to find out specific details. It was a failure. Our reports say that whatever it was literally exploded in their faces.

[npctext 32102]
text0_0=Sputtervalve will want some sort of proof that Gerenzo's dead. I think his mechanical arm will probably do.

[npctext 32103]
text0_0=Look at that thing... it'd take a gnome to come up with something like that. I can't understand why you'd cut off an arm, and replace it with that, when you could just keep both arms and add a third!$b$bGnomes, I tell you...$b$bAt least Gerenzo's out of commission. Hopefully that'll be enough proof, and Sputtervalve will assign me to one of the Tinkers' Union workshops in Gadgetzan or maybe even Undermine.

[npctext 32104]
text0_0=You're here to help with my delivery? Very good!

[npctext 32105]
text0_0=Vincent's body lies broken, and still.$b$bAlthough Deathstalker Adamant will send his report to Hadrec... whatever additional details Vincent gained must remain with him.$b$bBut clutched in his hand is a small trinket...

[npctext 32106]
text0_0=Once I know the foul beasts of Razorfen Kraul have been driven from their foul lair, I will be able to rest in peace, knowing that revenge has been served.$b$bHave you the driven the quilboar from the Kraul? Do you bring to me good news in the form of Razorflank's heart?

[npctext 32107]
text0_0=I see the nasty tribe of Razorfen Kraul now knows the pain of my people. Serves the foul beasts right.$b$bTo drive one from a holy land is a sin worthy of the most severe revenge.$b$bThank you, $N, for aiding me in my plight.

[npctext 32108]
text0_0=Hi hi hi! Did you get that venom??

[npctext 32109]
text0_0=All right! This venom is going to work great! Thanks, $N!$b$bNow I just need to boil it down, apply skipper-otomer, add a nega-catalyst, and... Drat! Where are my notes!?

[npctext 32110]
text0_0=My brother is making progress with his new fuel design, and that has me worried. I need to start work on a tortoise shell fuel tank as soon as possible!

[npctext 32111]
text0_0=You got them! Thanks, $N!

[npctext 32112]
text0_0=Well, you found me. Good for you.$b$bAre you here about that axe I made for Gath'Ilzogg? Or are you here to reclaim Duchess Pamay's honor?$b$bActually, I don't care which it is. If you're here to fight, then let's get it over with...

[npctext 32113]
text0_0=Fizzle sent you? Well that changes things! Of course I'll help you. Fizzle and his brother are two of the few people who don't want me dead!$b$bSo Fizzle wants to make pistons, eh? Pistons strong enough to take whatever stresses he has planned, and if I know Fizzle, then this new car of his is a volcano on wheels!

[npctext 32114]
text0_0=Do you have the tail fins? If I can't protect our car from its own speed, then it won't last long in these races.

[npctext 32115]
text0_0=Thank you, $N! After I grind these down and fuse them with a few other ingredients, the composite will be ready. And after that, the car will be safe from its own speed.$b$bSafe, as long as it doesn't hit anything...

[npctext 32116]
text0_0=Did you find any indurium flakes, $N. I have my forge heated up and ready to test them.

[npctext 32117]
text0_0=Ah yes, these will do fine. Now let's put them in some heat and see how they fare...

[npctext 32118]
text0_0=Ah, I see you have returned. Were you able to procure any Kraul Guano?

[npctext 32119]
text0_0=Splendid! This is just the start we needed, $N.

[npctext 32120]
text0_0=$N, have you been out into the Flats? Did you bring back that load of parts I wanted?

[npctext 32121]
text0_0=Whoa, look at all that! There's some good stuff in that heap of junk. I'm sure I can pawn it off for a hefty sum.$b$bAnd... is that an ear I see squashed between those two sheets of metal?? Ouch! Heh, I sure wouldn't want to be that pilot!$b$bThanks, $N. Here's your pay. And here's some advice, free of charge...$b$bIf you look hard enough, you can always find profit in someone else's tragedy.

[npctext 32122]
text0_0=Did you make it to Ratchet and get those parts?

[npctext 32123]
text0_0=Great, you got them! Now we need to get them to the gnomes. But first...$b$bLet's take out one small item...

[npctext 32124]
text0_0=Have you returned from the Scarlet Monastery? I'll need many hearts for this delightful experiment!$b$bNo doubt, Varimathras and the Dark Lady will be pleased to be rid of the Scarlet Scum as well...

[npctext 32125]
text0_0=My what an abundance of gore you have brought me, $N! Your efforts have been most excellent!

[npctext 32126]
text0_0=You have something for me? That's great! let's see it!

[npctext 32127]
text0_0=There they are! My hydro ratchets and repeater bolts! These will do just fine. Thank you!

[npctext 32128]
text0_0=You want to know about Nazz Steamboil? He's a racer pilot out in the Shimmering Flats, isn't he?$b$bYeah, I might be able to find something out about him... but it won't be easy. Or fast.$b$bOr cheap.

[npctext 32129]
text0_0=Back so soon? Do you have my dream dust?

[npctext 32130]
text0_0=Well, look at that. You found the dream dust!$b$bAnd how did you like the swamp, $N? It's not easy to get a hot meal there, is it?

[npctext 32131]
text0_0=Did you get anything on Nazz Steamboil? Anything he might want to keep a secret??

[npctext 32132]
text0_0=Well well! This is interesting... very interesting. Heh, perhaps I should bow to the goblin pilot the next time I see him.$b$bThis is worth plenty, $N. I'm sure Nazz will pay a small fortune to keep his secret... a secret.

[npctext 32133]
text0_0=Hello hello. And what brings a noble $R such as you down to Booty Bay?

[npctext 32134]
text0_0=I see. Kravel has a big scheme planned. He has a sinister mind -- I like that about him.$b$bSo you'll need something to addle wits, eh? Something powerful...$b$bI wonder if the mixture Zanzil feeds his zombies could be used...

[npctext 32135]
text0_0=Hello, $N. Was Fizzlebub able to help us?

[npctext 32136]
text0_0=Wonderful! Fizzlebub came through! I'll remember that next time I see him.$b$bAnd thank you, $N. You're doing a great job, and we both stand to make a lot of money from this...

[npctext 32137]
text0_0=Hi! You have something for me?

[npctext 32138]
text0_0=Stout? How considerate! Thank you!$b$bWe shouldn't be drinking with the race coming up, but... maybe my boys could do with just a little. Besides, it can't be that strong, can it?

[npctext 32139]
text0_0=Hello $N. How'd that stout work out? It's strong stuff, isn't it?

[npctext 32140]
text0_0=It says here that the fool's stout was a success. That's good news!$b$bIf you ever want more of the stuff, then let me know and I'll have you gather more of Zanzil's Mixture.

[npctext 32141]
text0_0=This is a dangerous land to be so casual, $C. What brings you to the wastes of Silithus?

[npctext 32142]
text0_0=Rabine sent you, did he? Well, consider yourself welcomed here... as much as this desolate and forsaken land can welcome someone.$b$bI wasn't alive during the time of the great tribulations that took place here, but there are parts of this desert that might as well be eerie pictures of that forgotten past. With your help, the Cenarion Circle might be able to bring finality to a threat that was supposed to have died generations ago.

[npctext 32143]
text0_0=I had thought that maybe the huge swirling hive near the ruins of the village had played a part in its demise. It would seem that your work has proven this to be correct; the proximity of the hive poses a threat to any future work we may do here.$b$bI thank you for your benevolence in freeing the souls of the fallen; such work is never easy, I know. When you're ready, however, I'd like to ask for your assistance once more...

[npctext 32144]
text0_0=Well, did it work? You're still in one piece, which is good news. Did you find anything?

[npctext 32145]
text0_0=What the... what is it?$b$bIt has the shape of a... box, maybe? It's encrusted over something fierce. Wait, there a portion here that's exposed... is that a book underneath all this gunk?$b$bI think you've stumbled across quite the find here, $N... well, at least I hope it is. Perhaps it is a journal or a log from ancient times, preserved in this shell.$b$bI think I know a way to find out what this is.

[npctext 32146]
text0_0=Do you have those Zanzil mixtures yet, $N?

[npctext 32147]
text0_0=All right, here's the Fool's Stout. Now go to the Shimmering Flats and give it to the gnome or goblin pit boss, and use it quick because it won't stay fresh for long.$b$bAnd if you ever need more... come back!

[npctext 32148]
text0_0=Have you defeated the foul Steelsnap, $N?

[npctext 32149]
text0_0=In defeating the creature Steelsnap, you have cleansed the Thousand Needles of a horrible taint.$b$bAnd that, $N, is your lesson this day.

[npctext 32150]
text0_0=Good day to you! You were sent by Mr. Flint in Menethil Harbor? Well Mr. Flint is a strong judge of character. If he sent you, then there's no doubt you belong here in Kalimdor!

[npctext 32151]
text0_0=Did you find Highperch, $N? Any luck with the wyverns there?

[npctext 32152]
text0_0=Ah, most of these are nearly bursting with venom, $N. Such are normally only gathered from young wyverns, or fertile females. It must have been quite a slaughter up there in Highperch!

[npctext 32153]
text0_0=Have you been to the Alterac Mountains, $N? Did you face the elusive Frostmaw?

[npctext 32154]
text0_0=Both strength and cunning were needed to find and defeat Frostmaw, $N. You have both.$b$bYour path has taken you to the valleys of Thousand Needles and to the high mountains of Alterac. It will one day lead you through all the Earthmother's lands, for such is the way of the $C.

[npctext 32155]
text0_0=$N, you're back! You found Martek? You spoke with him? What did he say? Can he help??$b$bTell me, tell me, tell me!!

[npctext 32156]
text0_0=...lemon crab, whipper root crab, and Ironforge surprise crab. That's about it.$b$bOh, hello there $N. Do you have them fine crab chunks I was telling you about?

[npctext 32157]
text0_0=Wow, these fine crab chunks are what I need. Thanks $N! I found this while I was fishing a while ago, and I have no use for it. Maybe you can do something with it. It sure don't make any good crab dishes.$b$bI told you all about crabs, right?

[npctext 32158]
text0_0=There's plenty of good dishes you use Darkshore groupers for. They're good to eat, but I think it's more fun catching them.$b$bYou caught any Darkshore groupers yet?

[npctext 32159]
text0_0=Them's some real nice groupers, $N! Thanks for helping me out!$b$bYou're at least as good of a fisherman as my cousin, Graun Blump. She also has a beard and she smells kinda funny, but that don't do nothing to stop her fishing. I reckon you have what it takes to use a Blump Family Fishing Pole.

[npctext 32160]
text0_0=Thanks again, friend! I told you I'd make it worth your while.

[npctext 32161]
text0_0=It is not until faced with unforeseen adversity that we begin to see how strong our spirits are. You took the leap of faith even though you had no guarantees that you would survive. Your mind is open, and your spirit is prepared for what is to come.$b$bIf you are willing, then the next of your tests is ready.

[npctext 32162]
text0_0=You must be prepared spiritually, physically and mentally for the challenges that lie ahead of you.$b$bToo often do we rush forward before we are ready. I consider it my duty to the youth, no matter which tribe they belong to, to prepare them for the dangers they may face after they leave the sanctity of their home.

[npctext 32163]
text0_0=Grenka was powerful, even by troll standards. You should be proud of your accomplishment this day.$b$bDuring your test of faith you displayed strength of spirit, and now you have shown endurance in battle by taking on the Roguefeather harpies, but the time has come for a new test.

[npctext 32164]
text0_0=Rok'Alim is also called the Pounder by the centaur tribes in Thousand Needles because of the thundering his fists make as he pummels the creatures brave, or stupid, enough to stand in his path.

[npctext 32165]
text0_0=The Test of Strength is done. You have shown strength and bravery, and you are now prepared for the final test before these rites are completed.

[npctext 32166]
text0_0=The days and nights grow colder throughout the world as goblins rape the land, and the night elves point fingers at the younger races. The Forsaken and orcs are not the only ones to blame for the hardships found throughout Kalimdor and Lordaeron. Many of the intelligent races have contributed to the world's pain. Dorn knows this, and he has sent you to me because you have shown the attributes necessary to realize it also.$b$bNow you stand before Braug.

[npctext 32167]
text0_0=Bring me the book after you've studied it. I will not ask you your question until after you have given me the book.

[npctext 32168]
text0_0=This is the book I named. There is hope you will answer my question correctly then... unless you've forgotten to study its contents.$b$bWhen you are prepared, speak to me again and I shall ask a question of you.

[npctext 32169]
text0_0=Braug sent you? Impossible.$b$b<Parqual looks you up and down.>$b$bBraved Dor'Danil, took a leap of faith, fought and overpowered a powerful elemental? Bah! You're probably a farce; some adventurer that overheard talk in a tavern. And now you think you have what it takes to pass my test. So be it... $C.

[npctext 32170]
text0_0=I hope you made the Scarlet Crusade suffer some before stealing the book from them.$b$bMy views of their kind are not unwarranted. The Crusade may have been followers of the Light at one time, but now, they seek to destroy any creatures that have not sided with their religion. They believe all undead, Forsaken or otherwise, must be cleansed, and those traveling in their lands must either be insane, or subject to the undead's powerful magics. Idiots. Idiots and fools; all of them.

[npctext 32171]
text0_0=This is the book I sent you to search for.$b$b<Parqual slowly caresses his hand over the top of the book as he stares down at it.>$b$bSo now you wish a question to prove your mind is as powerful as your body and spirit. If you have studied the book long enough, then I shall ask you your question and you can be done with these tests!

[npctext 32172]
text0_0=I hope you didn't kill any of the basilisks on the tracks themselves! It takes a long time for the carcasses to decay in the sun, and I'd rather not have to take a shovel out to clean up.

[npctext 32173]
text0_0=Do you have those bones for me? I was just about to start working on lightening the steering rig, but I don't want to open her up without all the parts I need.

[npctext 32174]
text0_0=Great! I can get the crew working on this right away. Thanks, $N!

[npctext 32175]
text0_0=Pozzik sent you, huh? You know, Pozzik was one of the most respected tinkerers in Undermine before he retired to start working on the racers.$b$bThe first thing he did when he joined the team was develop the two engine model racers. Could be that the businesses will suffer without him working with the Tinkers' Union, but who cares, right? There's nothing like the races!

[npctext 32176]
text0_0=Shipments to Ratchet? Let me just check the logbooks...$b$bNo, the most recent shipment I have on record of going out to Ratchet were boots from Drizzlik. Hasn't been much else, other than building supplies and tools. Definitely no race parts.

[npctext 32177]
text0_0=Oh, sure of course I know what you're talking about. Nope, can't help you though. Some of my men were supposed to go track down the blueprints for the fuel regulator, but they came back empty-handed.

[npctext 32178]
text0_0=Much as I hate to admit it, that gnome team they have out there is pretty good. Our boys need every edge they can get.

[npctext 32179]
text0_0=Now, let me just get a copy of these blueprints for my own notes and you can bring these straight to Pozzik. Wouldn't want him to think that one of his sponsors was abandoning him.

[npctext 32180]
text0_0=$N! Did you manage to track down the fuel regulator?

[npctext 32181]
text0_0=I was hoping that it would be already assembled, but this does present the unique opportunity to improve on the design from the ground up. Thanks, $N. I'll be able to sketch up some improved schematics, build the thing, and have it installed real soon.

[npctext 32182]
text0_0=You're the $R that's been helping Pozzik out, right? I was like you once, running around the pit area, helping with whatever work the mechanics would let me do.$b$bNow look at me! The goblin racing team's pilot extraordinaire!

[npctext 32183]
text0_0=How'm I supposed to show my face around the track without a little extra kick to get me going? It's a travesty, I tell you.

[npctext 32184]
text0_0=Just take a look at this beauty! Fifteen pounds of solid seaforium power! Once I get this strapped on to the side of my racer, I'll be around the track so fast I'll beat the gnomes twice!

[npctext 32185]
text0_0=As I'm sure you know, the Gizmorium can service all of your tinkering needs! How can I help you?

[npctext 32186]
text0_0=Only Razzeric would take a look at this and say that I'd somehow put some sort of safety lock on it. This booster is almost completely seaforium explosives. I already modified it so that more of its payload would be delivered upon use, but Razzeric is never content unless he goes to eleven!

[npctext 32187]
text0_0=Can you believe Pozzik put a bucket of sand on the racer? How am I supposed to hit my maximum speed with a bucket of sand under the seat?

[npctext 32188]
text0_0=Now that's more like it! I wish I could see the look on the gnomes' eyes when they see me set this baby off.$b$bToo bad I'll be too busy pulling off a new course record!

[npctext 32189]
text0_0=Once we have the filled phial, we can send it along to my associate, Rau, in the Thousand Needles. He was the one who requested the phial of water, so he'll better know how we can make use of it.

[npctext 32190]
text0_0=Very good. This should fill Rau's request just fine. Could you deliver this to him? You might enjoy spending some time out in the Needles.

[npctext 32191]
text0_0=I don't suppose you've been sent by Zangen, hm?

[npctext 32192]
text0_0=Hm, yes, this phial of water will serve our purposes perfectly. Because of the shared ancestry of the dryads and the centaurs, the water of the moonwells will enable us to breach the protection of the eternal flame surrounding the centaur relic.

[npctext 32193]
text0_0=I am eager to put my hands upon the Cloven Hoof. Have you taken it yet?

[npctext 32194]
text0_0=I sense a strange energy emanating from the Hoof... I have no doubt that we will discover surprising new information about the centaur from its study.$b$bMy thanks, $N. Now I must begin to decipher the mysteries you have brought to me.

[npctext 32195]
text0_0=Do you have the tooth of Deadmire, $N? Have you ended the creature's suffering?

[npctext 32196]
text0_0=Very good, $N.$b$bI am sure the hunt was not easy, but it is good to know the beast's pain has finally ended.

[npctext 32197]
text0_0=You have something for me?

[npctext 32198]
text0_0=Good work, $N. Our agent, Marg Nighteye, was stationed outside Theramore. He was charged to spy on the city. $b$bThis is his latest report, and it may be his last -- from your testimony, I fear that Marg met his end in the swamp...

[npctext 32199]
text0_0=You have another matter to report, $N?

[npctext 32200]
text0_0=This is the head of Marg Nighteye! As I feared, he is dead.$b$bLook at the wound on his neck! Could a weapon have made that ragged cut, or did some beast slay our agent?$b$bThis is a mystery we must solve, $N. We must discover if Marg's death was at the hands of the Alliance!

[npctext 32201]
text0_0=There is an angry spirit about you, brother. What brings you to Kin'weelay?

[npctext 32202]
text0_0=Ah, I now see. The spirit of this orc is bound in our world, boiling with rage from a task yet undone.$b$bWell, let us have words with this angry orc...

[npctext 32203]
text0_0=Hmph, you better have good reason to interrupt a man and his fishin'. I don't take kindly to peddlers, let alone beggars.

[npctext 32204]
text0_0=Hmm... <Jorgen looks up at you through squinted eyes.>$b$bAll right. I'll help ya, but not because I want to, but because I'm obligated.$b$bAnd let's get one thing straight: you're knowin' far more than you should to begin with. Let's keep this our little secret, and don't go blabbin' at any taverns about anything you find out. Understand?

[npctext 32205]
text0_0=Hello, Nibler. Is there something I can do for you? Perhaps you'd like to try some of our special Trias cheddar? Or a block of Darnassian bleu?

[npctext 32206]
text0_0=I'm sorry, a letter for me? Well, I'll be... not often you get a delivery that's not a crate or barrel when all you do is work. Let's see what this is about.$b$b<Elling looks up at you while he opens the letter.>$b$bYou look a little tense, you okay, Nibler?

[npctext 32207]
text0_0=Be careful out there, Nibler. I know Trias was the one to send you here, but that doesn't mean there isn't anything lurking out in the woods that couldn't cause you some trouble... especially with you investigating the Defias.

[npctext 32208]
text0_0=You're back safe and sound. Couldn't ask for much more than that, could you?$b$bNow, let's see what we have here. This looks pretty official as far as any Defias documents I've seen. But it could be a dupe just to throw you off track of whatever it is you're looking for.

[npctext 32209]
text0_0=My research with the Mudrock tongues is progressing nicely. I trust your crab hunt goes well?

[npctext 32210]
text0_0=These are wonderful specimens, $N! The shells are in perfect condition, and the meat is pink and tender. The blood of a chef is in your veins, I'm sure of it!

[npctext 32211]
text0_0=Oh, my uncle sent you, did he?$b$bWell I've been researching recipes and I have some leads, but I need help.$b$bHelp from someone willing to get his feet wet.

[npctext 32212]
text0_0=A pleasure to meet you, Nibler. I am Commander Samaul. I'm in charge of Miss Proudmoore's forces here in Theramore.$b$bAlthough I'm quite busy, if you have any questions, please feel free to speak up. I might have to keep it short, but there's no reason for me to be rude if you need my help.$b$bIf you plan on traveling out of the city, I'd suggest you be careful. Besides ogres, orcs and murlocs, the southern part of the swamp is filled with black dragons.

[npctext 32213]
text0_0=Hello, citizen. This is a dangerous place to be wandering about. I wouldn't hang around too long if you value your life.$b$bIf you keep your questions short, I'll see if I can help you. Just keep your eyes open for any of those filthy ogres. Rumor has it there's a Horde base somewhere in the swamps. The infiltrators are doing what they can to find it, but the process has been slow going and we've had little progress.

[npctext 32214]
text0_0=Hoofprints... It could have been the quilboar, I suppose. Or maybe even the centaur. Their presence in the Barrens is not insignificant, and I would not think it a stretch to commit such an act.$b$bDid I tell you? It wasn't just that the inn was burned down... The owner's woman and pup were killed. Bad business, that.$b$bNonetheless, I will send Kagoro to find where the tracks lead.

[npctext 32215]
text0_0=A letter from the dwarven lands? I wonder who would call from so far to the north...$b$bPlease, let me see the order.

[npctext 32216]
text0_0=Ah, a request from one of the Stormpikes. That's a proud clan, full of quality dwarves. Rich ones, too.$b$bThank you, $N. I'll get to work on Mountaineer Stormpike's shield by the end of the day.

[npctext 32217]
text0_0=That's right. I have a task that I can't do while I'm guarding. In fact, it'll take you far from Loch Modan.$b$bYour perfect chance for adventure!

[npctext 32218]
text0_0=You have a package for me?

[npctext 32219]
text0_0=Ah, very good. If initial reports are true, then the toxicity of these hearts could lead to further advances in our knowledge of poisons.$b$bThis is a welcome delivery, $N. Your reward is well earned.

[npctext 32220]
text0_0=You have something for me?

[npctext 32221]
text0_0=Ah yes, the heart samples of which Renferrel spoke. I am eager to experiment with these... it is always of interest to the Royal Apothecary Society when new forms of toxins are discovered.

[npctext 32222]
text0_0=The Gelkis cry when they hear your name, $N. They fear you and they hate you. They hate you like they hate the Magram!$b$bMaybe you are strong like the Magram. We will see...

[npctext 32223]
text0_0=If you are not our enemy, then you will do what I ask!

[npctext 32224]
text0_0=Yes, this is what I had! I will make it move again. It makes me laugh!

[npctext 32225]
text0_0=Zraedus was just telling me about the nosey little Infiltrator before you arrived.$b$bQuite a problem, indeed. The last thing we need is a busybody sniffing around Beggar's Haunt.$b$bI am sure the orcs of Stonard would be quite anxious to hear what our friend has to say. Seeing that they are our allies, ahem, we must help them to get any information they can from the human.$b$bWork with me, $N, and we will deliver a truth serum to Stonard.$b$bFor the Horde!$b$b...did I get that right?

[npctext 32226]
text0_0=Do tasks for the Magram, and I will help you.

[npctext 32227]
text0_0=Khan Shaka is dead! I will place his head on a pike, and keep it with me so Shaka can see the strength of the Magram!

[npctext 32228]
text0_0=Do what I ask. Prove to me that you are an ally of the Magram!

[npctext 32229]
text0_0=Khan Hratha is dead! Now the Magram are the strongest of the centaur! We will crush the others, and rule Desolace!$b$bWe will remember, you, $N, and you will be spared our hooves when all others are trampled.

[npctext 32230]
text0_0=Do you have the crystals?

[npctext 32231]
text0_0=Thank you, $N. We, are in your debt.

[npctext 32232]
text0_0=Greetings. And welcome to the Harborage.

[npctext 32233]
text0_0=You have gained the weapon of the dreaded Noboru? Is he then dead?$b$bThis is a joyous day for the Harborage. Noboru and his gang were a terror to us, wandering the swamps and killing any Draenei who crossed his path. He was a direct threat to our survival, and we did not have the strength to face him.$b$bWe are fortunate to have a friend in you, $N.

[npctext 32234]
text0_0=The keyhole of this strongbox is filled with black resin. It is impossible to open.$b$bBut Galen told you of a hidden latch on the box's bottom... $b$b...After a quick search the latch is found. The latch is flipped, and the strongbox opens...

[npctext 32235]
text0_0=Ah, $N. It has been a long time since you have last stepped into my home. It seems like many moons have passed since you took your first leap that set you upon your path.$b$bAnd now you return to me stronger than you once were... more enlightened. This pleases me. And you should be justly rewarded for seeing my tests to the end.

[npctext 32236]
text0_0=Helgrum wants a report, eh? I sent an outrunner to Stonard not three days past. Did he fail his mission? If Stonard does not have my report, then it appears he did fail.$b$bLet's hope the next runner I send has more skill, or more luck.

[npctext 32237]
text0_0=You returned. You have a report?

[npctext 32238]
text0_0=Thank you, $N. From Neeka's report, I see the Alliance is not without its own problems. And we may find that some enemies are shared between us.

[npctext 32239]
text0_0=Be silent a moment, $C. Even over the dull roar of the sea you can still hear those disgusting gurgles from the fish men.

[npctext 32240]
text0_0=No one knows what dark practices went on inside The Temple of Atal'Hakkar. But we do know that great and powerful forces of magic were used.$b$bWe must learn as much as we can about such magic. Perhaps the spells of the Atal'ai will prove of use to the Horde.$b$bOnce you have gathered enough Atal'ai artifacts from around the Pool of Tears, I can begin to understand what the trolls were hoping to accomplish and what went so horribly wrong.

[npctext 32241]
text0_0=Your diligence in collecting the Atal'ai artifacts is worthy of praise, $C.

[npctext 32242]
text0_0=The sea seems vast and relentless, but you have stained her with the blood of her own spawn. The fish men know pain. Their stupidity will force them to refortify their ranks from the devastation you've caused, and that is good.$b$bLet their gurgling screams overshadow the sea's roar long into the night. I shall smile every time I hear one of them silenced.$b$bReturn to me if you wish to slay more of the fish men. I will gladly reward you again.

[npctext 32243]
text0_0=Ah, $N, you've returned. Good. I've finished crafting more weapons for our fight against the murlocs. For bringing us the fresh sawtooth meat, and for bringing a small smile to Katar's face, I offer one of them to you.

[npctext 32244]
text0_0=Not until the sea and all her children are silenced will I be pleased... especially those disgusting fish men.

[npctext 32245]
text0_0=Well done, $C. I call for more of their blood. Let all the fish men perish.

[npctext 32246]
text0_0=You are brave to come here. Brave or foolish...

[npctext 32247]
text0_0=You bring me the summoning artifacts of the Atail'ai?$b$bI see Jammal'an the Prophet is leading the disciples of the Chamber of Blood towards their chosen fate. Has Hakkar returned to the Temple I wonder? Has their fate been met?

[npctext 32248]
text0_0=I have a cask of wine waiting for your success, $N. It's only right I taste the goods before I have it shipped back to my customers.

[npctext 32249]
text0_0=Ah, this should be perfect. I can't wait to taste these after they are prepared perfectly over an open fire. You should take a sample of it with you on your travels. It truly is delicious.

[npctext 32250]
text0_0=Putanni, noble $C. I am Keldran, student of magic... and other mystical arts.$b$bThe business Craven sent you here to speak to me about requires a touch more subtlety than you've previously needed, but that does not mean you can not still aid our cause.$b$bPlease, make yourself comfortable, and I shall tell you why the Warchief has need of my aid... and yours.$b$bIt starts with appearances, $N. How the Horde sees itself. How our allies see us. And most importantly, how our enemies see us.

[npctext 32251]
text0_0=Greetings, $C. You bring news from Orgrimmar; that is good.$b$bThe demon infestation overwhelms this area even more than the smell of centaur dung. The horse-men claim this land as their own, but clearly there are influences out of their control that will crush them if not kept in check.$b$bIt does not please me that we aid the centaur indirectly, but it is for the good of the Horde, so I do my duty for the Warchief, even if it means helping the warlocks within the Horde.

[npctext 32252]
text0_0=Ah, yes. Aid from those loyal to the Warchief is always appreciated.$b$bMy name is Maurin. I am here at the behest of Keldran and the Warchief cub Thrall. It is my desire to aid the youngling leader against the evils that threaten his rule.$b$bCome, come closer, $C. I shall explain to you my plan for removing the festering boil that is the Burning Blade.

[npctext 32253]
text0_0=Putanni, noble $C. I am Keldran, student of magic... and other mystical arts.$b$bThe business Craven sent you here to speak to me about requires a touch more subtlety than you've previously needed, but that does not mean you can not still aid our cause.$b$bPlease, make yourself comfortable, and I shall tell you why the Warchief has need of my aid... and yours.$b$bIt starts with appearances, $N. How the Horde sees itself. How our allies see us. And most importantly, how our enemies see us.

[npctext 32254]
text0_0=It has been quite some time since we spoke, $C. I hope your journey was successful.$b$bWhat knowledge did you gain from the exiled Atal'ai in the Hinterlands?

[npctext 32255]
text0_0=If the Atal'ai fetishes hold the power to summon Hakkar and fulfill Jammal'an's prophecy they must be seized. Such powers must be understood by the Horde!

[npctext 32256]
text0_0=Brave $C, you have proven yourself to be a great champion of the Horde.$b$bNow this collection of fetishes of Hakkar must be dealt with at once!

[npctext 32257]
text0_0=Once Jammal'an has been removed, I stand a chance of returning to my people.$b$bWith Jammal'an as their spiritual leader, the Atal'ai face certain destruction.

[npctext 32258]
text0_0=Jammal'an's reckless trust of false visions led my people to their eternal doom.$b$bI thank you, $C, for avenging my exile. I mourn for my people. I have no home to return to.

[npctext 32259]
text0_0=Your power is little now, though I suspect already you sense the possibilities.$b$bEven the dead might feel alive, with that power coursing through us.

[npctext 32260]
text0_0=Though you are still untested and young in your learning, you have proven that you possess sufficient ability to master the summoning and binding of an imp. Do not be deceived by an imp's size. Though it lacks physical strength, it possesses powers and a cleverness that will serve you well.$b$bAttend me carefully, $N, for I will not repeat this lesson, and I will leave its mastery to you.

[npctext 32261]
text0_0=You were sent by Carendin? Sithel, then.$b$bDo not think light of me because my sight is gone. I see things that lie behind now, with clarity I had never known. What I once thought a curse, is now a boon.

[npctext 32262]
text0_0=Of the powers from beyond the void, the succubus is one of the most dangerous, as the weak are most easily wrapped around its fingers.$b$bRemember that now and in the future.

[npctext 32263]
text0_0=Again, you have done well, Sithel. It has been quite some time since I have seen a young $C with as much potential as you. Be assured that I will continue to watch your progress, and prepare and assist you in your future trials.$b$bFor now, let me show you the summoning spell for your newly dominated succubus.

[npctext 32264]
text0_0=I have been pleasantly surprised by the speed of your progress so far, Sithel. Bring me the hearts and you will impress me once again.

[npctext 32265]
text0_0=The heart of a goodly man seems much the same as any, when you see it like this, don't you think?$b$bPerhaps we possess something of a... different... view on the subject. These will do, though. I have no doubt that a succubus would be attracted by their purity.

[npctext 32266]
text0_0=I thought those Venture Company higher-ups were slave drivers, but then I met Sputtervalve, the cruelest of them all!$b$bHa! Though it's better than being out of a job, I suppose... Or worse, working with that Gerenzo. If you're here to help, I've got something for you to do.

[npctext 32267]
text0_0=I am very interested in examining the hides from the deviate creatures who have infested these caves. Have you had any luck in collecting some, $C?

[npctext 32268]
text0_0=Your efforts shall not go unnoticed in gathering these hides, $N.$b$bThank you for your dedication.

[npctext 32269]
text0_0=$N, we, the Disciples of Naralex, need your help. Our numbers are dwindling with our master trapped in his twisted nightmare. We have not the forces necessary to deal with the corrupt creatures which now haunt these caverns.$b$bI beg of you, enter the caves and wage war on the deviate creatures!

[npctext 32270]
text0_0=As a Disciple of Naralex, I commend your bravery, $N.$b$bYour aid in ridding the caverns is the first step in our long plight to see the Barrens restored.$b$bThank you and may you prosper.

[npctext 32271]
text0_0=A mighty victory for us all, $N. Let us rejoice in your success. I trust now that our future here is not as bleak as I once thought.$b$bThe demons will be slain, the Burning Blade will fail in their efforts, and we may one day have a place we can safely call home again.

[npctext 32272]
text0_0=Yes, it is true. I know of the druids in the Wailing Caverns. I have seen their twisted, scaled faces. I know their crimes, and I know their plans.$b$bYou must stop them, $N.

[npctext 32273]
text0_0=Do you have the scales, $N? Unless you can withstand the attacks of the thunder lizards, you will not benefit from my instruction.

[npctext 32274]
text0_0=Ah. I see you have defeated the thunder lizards, which proves you are tough. Now I will show you how tough skin and shrewd movements can combine to form an impenetrable wall of defense.$b$bLearn your lesson well, $N. And be ready for future instruction.

[npctext 32275]
text0_0=My eyes have long dried out from staring into the forge's flame, but some things I can still see. I can see you want something.$b$bAnd if you found your way here, then I can guess what you desire.

[npctext 32276]
text0_0=Do you have my steel bars?

[npctext 32277]
text0_0=You found them! And all the bars are here, which doesn't surprise me. I didn't think the Razormanes would know what to do with fine steel like this.$b$bThank you, $N. Here is your reward. May it serve you well.

[npctext 32278]
text0_0=Hello, young one. Here for some instruction, are you?

[npctext 32279]
text0_0=Patience is earth's greatest virtue. The earth witnesses the cycle of all things: the mountains becoming deserts; rivers becoming canyons. The earth is the most stubborn and wise of all the elements and it does not tolerate impatience.$b$bThe earth beckons you now because a time of conflict draws near. When you return to me successful, then you shall be that much closer to being made whole.$b$bOthers will be envious of your wisdom and hate you for their ignorance.

[npctext 32280]
text0_0=Excellent. Your success shows that you are prepared.$b$bOf all the elements, earth represents the foundation of all things. It is your strength, your stamina, and your patience. Earth will protect you, but only if shown the proper respect. Like the other elements, even earth can be fickle. Earth is the basis for life, and by observing its laws, you will gain greater wisdom. Never forget the secrets earth shares with you.$b$bI shall make a sapta for you now, and by accepting it, you will realize your path.

[npctext 32281]
text0_0=Ah... Unjai... pleased is the earth to have you here.$b$bBound together in body and spirit, you will go forward knowing that the mountains are your strength; the plains, your patience; and the world itself your essence.$b$bStanding before the earth humbly is all that is required of you for you to pass this rite. But the others are not as passive. They may be chaotic and often violent, but such is the nature of the elements. Dual natures opposing one another, you must come to learn these things intricately.

[npctext 32282]
text0_0=I wish to be the first to welcome you fully to the first of four paths that will forever lead you in your destiny.$b$bIf you have the stone the earth gave to you, I will give you the totem it promised.$b$bIf not, then be gone with you until you have found your way.

[npctext 32283]
text0_0=Excellent!$b$bThe totem I will craft for you is more than a symbol of your status among $C--it has abilities beyond that. One use of the totem is as a focus for spells. Those spells are tied to the earth, and as you earn greater and greater wisdom, more of the earth's abilities will be made accessible to you.$b$bThe trainers will know when you are ready for greater knowledge.$b$bBut for now, take this earth totem, and a scroll to teach you your first ability.

[npctext 32284]
text0_0=The earth is patient, and will wait for you until you are ready because she knows in time all things erode and are reborn. It is the cycle of things. Mountains become deserts. Rivers become canyons. The earth is the most stubborn and wise of all the elements.$b$bYou must learn patience and stamina above all things. The earth calls for you now because she feels you are ready. Consider this your rebirth if you succeed. You will never be able to go back to ignorance afterwards.

[npctext 32285]
text0_0=Good, $N. Your return here signifies that you are indeed prepared for the next step.$b$bOf all the elements, earth represents the foundation of all things. It is your strength, your stamina, and your patience. The Earth Mother will protect you, but only if you show her proper respect. She is the basis for life, and by observing her laws, you will gain a greater wisdom. Never forget the secrets she shares with you.$b$bI shall make your sapta for you now, and by accepting it, a new path will open before you.

[npctext 32286]
text0_0=Ah... $N... pleased is the earth to have you here.$b$bBound together in body and spirit, you will go forward knowing that the mountains are your strength; the plains, your patience; and the world itself your essence.$b$bStanding before the earth humbly is all that is required of you for you to pass this rite. But the others are not as passive. They may be chaotic and often violent, but such is the nature of the elements. Dual natures opposing one another, you must come to learn these things intricately.

[npctext 32287]
text0_0=Greetings, $N. You would not return to me if you had not accomplished your task. May I be the first to welcome you fully to the first path of four that will forever rule your travels.$b$bIf you have the stone the earth gave to you, I will give you the totem it promised. If not, then I pity you. There is much pride to be had when you've fully dedicated yourself to the elements.

[npctext 32288]
text0_0=Splendid.$b$bThe totem I will craft for you is more than a symbol--it has abilities beyond that. One use of the totem is a focus for spells. Those spells are tied to the earth, and as you earn greater and greater wisdom, more of the earth's abilities will be made accessible to you. Trainers found throughout Kalimdor will know when you are ready for greater knowledge and will let you know as much when you visit them.$b$bBut for now, take this earth totem, and a scroll to teach you your first ability.

[npctext 32289]
text0_0=Hmmm, Narm sent you to me, did he?$b$bWell then, Narm could always be trusted, so that must mean you're ready to take part of the next sapta--the sapta of fire.$b$bI see it in your eyes already, the burning, the desire. You've tasted power, and now you're ready for more of it. Patience, $N. Remember what earth taught you. Power and destruction will come easily, but you must still know when to stay your hand.

[npctext 32290]
text0_0=Greetin's, $N. You've found yerself at the Shrine of the Dormant Flame. Only those knowledgeable enough in the shamanistic arts will ever learn the secrets of this place and the power it holds. I'm sorry you made the trip all this way, only to be turned back now--the journey up here is far from safe after all--but I am the keeper of the shrine, and I cannot allow just anyone to wander around here.

[npctext 32291]
text0_0=Ah, my mistake, $N. I apologize. I did not realize you possessed the Torch. I am pleased to make your acquaintance.$b$bMany adventurers find their way here while looking for lost treasure or the promise of mystical creatures to slay, only to be turned away from a seemingly empty shrine. But we know the truth, do we not, $N?$b$bThis shrine holds a greater secret from the mundane members of the Horde. To us, it is sacred.

[npctext 32292]
text0_0=I have enough ingredients for a sapta of fire if you can find the reagent pouch and some fire tar. The Burning Blade fanatics carry the proper components for most of their spells in those pouches, and usually have enough of the items I need that we will not have to search much farther for anything else.$b$bThe saptas are always made from ingredients that are closely tied to their respective elements. It makes our work easier because of the warlocks' ties to fire.

[npctext 32293]
text0_0=These will do nicely, $N.$b$bFire is more than chaos and destruction--do well to remember that. It is also about life, and creation. All things are tied together in such a way. Forces oppose one another, but at the same time, one cannot exist without the other. Both extinguish one another, but also give one another meaning. Always remember this.$b$bUsing different types of magic in conjunction with one another will show not only true skill, but great wisdom.

[npctext 32294]
text0_0=The brazier stands about a third your height, and looks normal, save for the inscriptions along its smooth metal rails. The metal shows no signs of wear from the weather, and the bowl seated at the top of it feels cool to the touch.

[npctext 32295]
text0_0=A white hot flame ignites within the bowl as you place the ember within. You can feel the magical effects of the sapta coursing through your body and the fire dances rhythmically before you.$b$bYou place the top of the torch within the basin, and it immediately catches on fire.

[npctext 32296]
text0_0=Yes, $N? What do you have there?

[npctext 32297]
text0_0=Your spirit burns brighter than any torch I've ever seen, $N, and for that, you should be proud.$b$bIf you continue down this path, the elements will be yours to command, and our brethren will look to you for guidance and wisdom. Let me be the first to congratulate you and present to you your newest totem.

[npctext 32298]
text0_0=For the time being, I shall give you what you need to focus your spells and to call upon the spirits of air. Take this totem, and when you are ready, train with me some more.

[npctext 32299]
text0_0=So he couldn't find his way back on his own? Figures.$b$bWell, I guess you deserve something for your troubles....

[npctext 32300]
text0_0=Did you find my gaffer jacks, $N? Without my gaffer jacks I can't tune my stintle pegs!

[npctext 32301]
text0_0=I can't believe you found them! You must be the luckiest $R in Kalimdor!

[npctext 32302]
text0_0=Did you find any electropellers? I'll need them if I'm to continue my research on duck decoys...

[npctext 32303]
text0_0=I can't believe it! You found them! You are the best fisherman I've ever seen!$b$bThank you, $N. And here, take these. Although you're so good and you probably don't need them, they will help you with your fishing.

[npctext 32304]
text0_0=Hello, $N. Do you have the elixirs to trade?

[npctext 32305]
text0_0=These are nicely mixed. You take great care in your trade, $N, and that is important for an alchemist.$b$bHere are your herbs, freshly gathered. May you use them well.

[npctext 32306]
text0_0=Those feather charms the novices carry have some sort of magical power to them. It will be interesting to research them. I wouldn't have expected it from the trolls.

[npctext 32307]
text0_0=Very good, very good! You've done well, Anengineer. Perhaps the interest that is being shown in you is deserved, after all.$b$bThat'll be for the others to decide--assuming your imp doesn't overpower you and nip your career in the bud. For now, I'm satisfied that you'll probably survive your first few months as a $C.$b$bA word about the imp, Anengineer. As a $R knows, don't let its size fool you, its magic can be very dangerous.

[npctext 32308]
text0_0=Yes, young one? What can Kauth do for you?$b$bThe journey here from the Mesa can be a tremendous burden for some, but a welcome sight for others. Which is it for you, I wonder?

[npctext 32309]
text0_0=Ah, the furs I was expecting. Thank you.$b$bThese came faster than I had expected. They will make good blankets for anyone who wishes to stay here.$b$bPlease feel free to stay as long as you like. My inn is always open and all of our people are welcome here. And don't underestimate a good night's rest, it can make a great difference while you're out traveling.

[npctext 32310]
text0_0=Have you been to Vejrek's hut, $N? Is that $R stink I smell on you?

[npctext 32311]
text0_0=Vejrek sure was an ugly one, eh? Nicely done, $N! You have what it takes, now let's start your lesson...$b$bYou may not know it, but a strong defense is very important to a $C. It keeps him standing against foes that'd fell others, and that's what your allies need.

[npctext 32312]
text0_0=Ah, $N. I heard the warriors of Dun Morogh bouncing your name around. I hope you haven't spent all your time in the breweries!

[npctext 32313]
text0_0=Muren sent you, did he? Yes, I can make you a nice weapon... but before I do that, I have a favor to ask of you.$b$bDon't worry. It's plenty dangerous and could mean your death; it's exactly the sort of job a $C wants.

[npctext 32314]
text0_0=Have you entered Ironband's Compound? Did you find the umbral ore?

[npctext 32315]
text0_0=You found it! Well done!$b$bI hope you killed a host of Dark Iron dwarves while searching. I fear that Ironband's compound won't be the last place we see them.$b$bBut thank you for the ore, $N. I'm eager to work it and find its properties.

[npctext 32316]
text0_0=Even the older and wiser can be unmanned by the wiles of youth and beauty, $N. A piece of advice you would do well to remember throughout your life.

[npctext 32317]
text0_0=Surena was talented, but not enough so to gain mastery of $C magic on her own. It's a shame to see talent wasted, but sometimes it is necessary.$b$bI hope my investment in you will bear different results.

[npctext 32318]
text0_0=I cannot show you how to control a voidwalker until you have overtaken one.

[npctext 32319]
text0_0=Top notch work, $N... top notch! You've thinned down the nomad population to a point where we can actually take the fight to them!$b$bIf you haven't already, talk to Spigot Operator Luglunket here; he gives a bounty on any of the Wastewander water pouches you may have run across while bringing those nomads to justice!

[npctext 32320]
text0_0=Got the five Wastewander Water Pouches we need? If you do, then the Gadgetzan Water Company Care Package, Model 103-XB, will be yours!

[npctext 32321]
text0_0=Excellent - the more water pouches we are able to reclaim, the further away from disaster we'll all be! Keep 'em coming, and I will be sure to reward you for every five water pouches you bring me.

[npctext 32322]
text0_0=Do you have the items, $N? Gathering them is the proof I need that you have the strength to face Cyclonian.

[npctext 32323]
text0_0=You have gathered the items for my spell, and have shown me your strength and cunning. But the next stage of our quest is even more perilous.$b$bLet us hope your strength does not falter.

[npctext 32324]
text0_0=$N, I must have the whirlwind heart!

[npctext 32325]
text0_0=You did it! You defeated Cyclonian and gained the Whirlwind Heart!

[npctext 32326]
text0_0=Your task is yet undone, Sictor. It is not wise for a $C to show fear...

[npctext 32327]
text0_0=Well done, Sictor. Ulag was no minor agent of the Scourge. You have shown the Deathguards, and hence the Dark Lady, that you are a $C of skill and resolve, and are worthy of further instruction.

[npctext 32328]
text0_0=Yes, it is true. I have need for your skills in combat. My means are small, but my task aids both me and the Forsaken's cause. Do it, and your reward will be twofold.

[npctext 32329]
text0_0=Do you have the heirlooms, Sictor?

[npctext 32330]
text0_0=Ah! You retrieved them! Now the last semblance of honor and memory is stripped from the cursed Agamand lands. The family truly is no more!

[npctext 32331]
text0_0=You are here for my trial, $N?

[npctext 32332]
text0_0=Do you have the antennae? If so then give them to me quickly, for twitching antennae do not twitch forever...

[npctext 32333]
text0_0=Nicely done, $N! In passing the trial at the Field of Giants, you take one more step down the $C's path.

[npctext 32334]
text0_0=Yes, you have come. This is good, for we have much to discuss, you and I.

[npctext 32335]
text0_0=Do you have the items on my scroll, $N?

[npctext 32336]
text0_0=You brought all that I asked. Now, I will do my part...

[npctext 32337]
text0_0=You are here for leg armor? Great!$b$bUm... am I making the armor for you, or are you making it for me?$b$bThat was joke. Was it funny? I can't tell... I lost my sense of humor the same time I lost my sense of smell. Which was about the same time I stopped breathing.

[npctext 32338]
text0_0=Do you have the horn? Is the matriarch free of pain?

[npctext 32339]
text0_0=You have completed your task, $N, and shown me your worth and resolve. The helm will be yours...

[npctext 32340]
text0_0=Is it not vexing to have the subject of your desire within your grasp, but to have no way of getting to it?

[npctext 32341]
text0_0=Hmmm, now this is interesting. You've more than proved your worth with this, Weir. I am quite impressed. Consider yourself the newest member of the Shattered Hand. And take this, it will be a great help to you in the future, I think.

[npctext 32342]
text0_0=I sense that Zalazane's ju-ju heaps were destroyed, and with time, and luck, the flow of magic in Durotar will return to normal.$b$bA great deed you have done for your people, $N. And you have shown your worth to us, the mages of the Horde.

[npctext 32343]
text0_0=Yeah, what do you need?

[npctext 32344]
text0_0=You find a nasty ball of water and decide to bring it to me? Who am I, the Earthen Ring or something?$b$bActually, that does give me an idea... perhaps you do need the Earthen Ring for this. I mean, if it helps clear up the situation at the lake for good, then I'm all for it.$b$bYou know who the Earthen Ring are, $N?

[npctext 32345]
text0_0=$N, I have a mission for you, here in the $C district. Listen closely, for there is no time to waste.

[npctext 32346]
text0_0=Have you captured the creatures, $N? They must be studied in order to determine the reason behind their arri

[npctext 32347]
text0_0=Greetings, $N. I am pleased to see you, and hope you have time to listen to an old man's words...

[npctext 32348]
text0_0=I am pleased you have returned with your skin intact, Mithel. Do you have the water sample? I am eager to study its properties.

[npctext 32349]
text0_0=Ah, very good. I trust the satyrs of Xavian gave you little trouble?$b$bThank you, Mithel. I will study this sample of Xavian water immediately.

[npctext 32350]
text0_0=Greetings, Mithel. Deino said you would come, and would bring the laughing sisters' hair. Do you have it?

[npctext 32351]
text0_0=Ah, this hair will weave into a fine robe, Mithel. It is a pity the laughing sisters had to die to part with it, though I do doubt they would ever give it willingly.$b$bA pity, but only a small one.

[npctext 32352]
text0_0=It is a fool who believes a charge with axe drawn is more dangerous than a knife in the dark.

[npctext 32353]
text0_0=Hm, while I am glad to hear that Tazan is no longer with us, a locked satchel does us no good. We need the information kept within.$b$bThis should prove a worthy second challenge for one who wishes to join the Shattered Hand.

[npctext 32354]
text0_0=So Gnoarn doesn't trust my reconnaissance abilities? I wonder why...$b$bNevermind that, I need your assistance! Nay! The movement needs your assistance!

[npctext 32355]
text0_0=Have you found the Gnoam Sprecklesprocket, $N?

[npctext 32356]
text0_0=Well done, $N. Thanks to you, Gnomeregan is one step closer to its day of liberation!

[npctext 32357]
text0_0=Do you bring word from central command?

[npctext 32358]
text0_0=You have done Auberdine a great service, $N, but your task is not yet complete.

[npctext 32359]
text0_0=You have fought for Auberdine with bravery and honor, $N. In our war torn lands, death and despair are common. Many will not rise to meet the challenge of life in our new home, choosing instead to hide in their homes or escape to the more fortified lands of the Alliance.$b$bThank you, $N. Perhaps someday soon we shall fight along side as comrades versus another foe.

[npctext 32360]
text0_0=Rest and relaxation for the tired and cold -- that's our motto! Please, take a seat by the fire and rest your weary bones.$b$bWould you like to try a sampling of some of our fine food and drink?

[npctext 32361]
text0_0=How might I be of service to you, young one? Are you here to rest in the inn? Do you require a hearthstone?

[npctext 32362]
text0_0=Ah yes, the delivery of herbs from Shadowglen. It is a shame Porthannius could not bring it himself, for we have much to discuss, he and I. But I am glad to get the herbs nonetheless, and I am glad you came.$b$bWhile you are here, please, rest yourself. Heroes must keep their strength and spirits high, and must find rest and solace whenever they may. For to neglect one's peace of body and mind is a sure path to failure.$b$bSo... rest.

[npctext 32363]
text0_0=Hi there! Come in, take a seat by the fire and warm yourself with a flagon of ale.

[npctext 32364]
text0_0=Ah, at last, the supplies from Hands! I was beginning to worry, we've had scarce word from Anvilmar ever since the troggs overran the pass.$b$bThanks for bring this to me, Smishir. And please, make yourself comfortable. You must be tired after your journey.

[npctext 32365]
text0_0=Welcome to Razor Hill!

[npctext 32366]
text0_0=Ah, this is the food Ukor brought to the Valley of Trials. Did they not need it? Well, I guess they like to starve you heroes in training. Builds spirit, they say!$b$bThank you for returning the food. I'll stick it back on the shelves... but here, let me offer you some refreshment first!$b$bAnd don't forget to rest here in the inn. You may be a brave $C ready to take on the world, but if your energy is sapped you won't be doing yourself, or the Horde, much good.

[npctext 32367]
text0_0=The pot is empty and I'm hungry! What's taking you so long?

[npctext 32368]
text0_0=Fantastic! Try it and tell me what you think, $N!

[npctext 32369]
text0_0=Remains of a paladin: Reading the journal reveals that after much effort, the paladin had identified the location of all three missing gems:$b$bThe Shadowforge dwarves hid the ruby in their barricaded area as they battled the Troggs for control of Uldaman.$b$bThe troggs stashed the topaz in an urn located near some unusual inhabitants of Uldaman - Alliance dwarves!$b$bFinally, the trogg elder himself took the sapphire as his own.

[npctext 32370]
text0_0=Talvash's image comes into focus from the waters of the scrying bowl.$b$b"Wow, you're still alive! Did you manage to find the gems? Are you truly the savior of my reputation I have hoped for? Please tell me you didn't waste a charge on the phial just to chat; those things are NOT cheap, and I'm already in dire financial strai

[npctext 32371]
text0_0=Have you obtained the magenta fungus caps I need for my alchemical work? No caps - no reward!

[npctext 32372]
text0_0=Well done $N, you've proven your worth once again! The caps will be an interesting study, you betcha.$b$bAnd now, as promised, enjoy a taste of one of my more potent restorative brews from my personal stock...$b$bIf you are a skilled alchemist, then perhaps we might have some additional business to conduct. Regardless, I thank you for your assistance!

[npctext 32373]
text0_0=You have seen the Chamber of Khaz'mul? Amazing! Baelog was sure it existed, but I must admit that I had my doubts.$b$bThank you, $N. With luck your finding will incite our leaders to renew their efforts to retake Uldaman. And if it is ever again under Ironforge control, then the secrets of the Chamber of Khaz'mul will be ours!

[npctext 32374]
text0_0=Have you gotten the things I need yet? You won't get paid unless you bring me those reagents.

[npctext 32375]
text0_0=Ah, well done! These should last me for a little while, at least. Here is your pay as promised.$b$bIf you're interested, I have some more reagents I could use. These, however, are only found in the depths of the Uldaman excavation. They will not be easy to get, but I will make it worth your while if you are interested in helping me again.$b$bPerhaps something more than some shiny coins, yes?

[npctext 32376]
text0_0=The voice of the stone watcher seems to resonate within your very inner being:$b$b"You must first satisfy the data assimilation prerequisite of Discs of Norgannon; once you fulfill this requirement, you will then be permitted to obtain a portable version of the stored data. Please be sure you have fully explored the information within this repository first."

[npctext 32377]
text0_0=Following the instructions of the stone watcher, you once again access the Discs of Norgannon now that you have learned about the history of the Earthen, the troggs, and the dwarves. A faint, brief hum is heard from within the discs. The stone watcher then speaks:$b$b"The discs have now been synthesized. Access the Discs of Norgannon once more to receive your personal copy."

[npctext 32378]
text0_0=Yes young one, I see you marching into my tent with intensity in your stride... with determination in your purpose. You seek my counsel is some matter of grave importance to the Horde? Perhaps you wish a mystery of the universe revealed to you?

[npctext 32379]
text0_0=What are these here then?$b$bImpressive, young one! These discs, in them I sense secrets that the earth has held on to tightly for many years. You were very wise to bring them here to me.

[npctext 32380]
text0_0=You seem to have found the remains of the $C that Dran had mentioned from before. Searching the remains uncovers what would appear to be his journal. The book is in poor condition, as dried blood has stained most of the text in the book. What you can read, however, is gibberish; it is written in the native tongue of the humans, to the best of your knowledge.$b$bYou will need the book translated if you are to glean any knowledge from it.

[npctext 32381]
text0_0=Mighty $C, I know what you are doing out here in the Badlands. I know you seek my gift of tongues. You're after the parts to that necklace you found in Uldaman.$b$bSurprised? Don't be - it's my job to know such things. Instead, let's discuss what you're going to do for a translated journal. Trust me - I'm the only one you'll find that can translate it.$b$bBetter still, let me make you a better offer than Dran Droffers is, and it'll let you still complete your deal with them. Interested now, yes?

[npctext 32382]
text0_0=You've thought about it, yes? You're a smart $C if you take this deal - you and I will get what we both want, and Droffers and Son Salvage will think they're getting what they want.

[npctext 32383]
text0_0=You know a good deal when you see one - I knew I could count on you.$b$bIt will be just a moment while I cast a spell to quickly translate the human tongue into a form you will understand. I am a troll of my word; ask anyone in the Horde about Jarkal Mossmeld. Now, let's get this started...

[npctext 32384]
text0_0=Well, look who it is! Took your sweet time getting here, I see. Let's hope this isn't a waste of my time! You'll not get paid unless you have everything I asked for. And trust me on this - we'll be double and triple checking everything!

[npctext 32385]
text0_0=Yep, it's all here. Say, mind if we keep the bag too? No? Thanks, appreciate it! Har!$b$bThis necklace will be our greatest haul yet! Don't feel too bad though; I'm sure the necklace wouldn't fit you anyway. Har again!$b$bA deal is a deal, so here's your fee for the salvage. Our business is done here for now; check back later to see if we have more work. Until then, beat it!

[npctext 32386]
text0_0=The power source you gave me exceeded every expectation I had for it. I was able to make both you and me a necklace, and I have enough left over to make at least three more. They will fetch quite the fee, with Droffers and Son Salvage none the wiser.$b$bHere you go, my friend. I give you my thanks on a splendid job... and something quite special for your trouble.

[npctext 32387]
text0_0=Perhaps Zando'zan was wrong. Zando'zan apologizes.

[npctext 32388]
text0_0=Well, at least you still have all of your body parts. Did you find the treasure?$b$b

[npctext 32389]
text0_0=Incredible! Improbable! Simply amazing! You've got talent, Weir. Either that or you're the luckiest man alive!$b$bHere's your cut of the action. I'm sure you would make better use of this stuff than I could.$b$b

[npctext 32390]
text0_0=Another one? The last five that crazy troll sent me ended up as shark food. Let's hope you fare a little better, eh?$b$b

[npctext 32391]
text0_0=What's that you have there? A parchment? You're not a scholar, I hope...

[npctext 32392]
text0_0=Ah, that's my parchment. I heard you'd be coming to the Valley, Borked. I'm glad to see you made it--let's hope you survive the trials ahead. Like I said, as you gain in power, come to me--I will do what I can to train you in the ways of the $C.$b$bGood luck, Borked, and return to me whenever you feel ready.

[npctext 32393]
text0_0=Do you have the power stones, $N? I have a robotic rodent that needs a power supply...

[npctext 32394]
text0_0=That's great, you found some! Thanks a lot, $N. You're the most dependable $R I've met!$b$bI can't wait to try these on some devices I've been tinkering with. I bet that, under the right circumstances, devices powered with these stones will keep going, and going, and going...

[npctext 32395]
text0_0=Please move swiftly. I can only hope that my emerald dreamcatcher has been unharmed by the furbolg.$b$bHave you recovered it yet, $N?

[npctext 32396]
text0_0=My emerald dreamcatcher is of great importance to me. It is a gift only given to few. Thank you for returning it, $N.

[npctext 32397]
text0_0=Greetings, $C! Are you here for alchemy training, or perhaps something else?

[npctext 32398]
text0_0=Well $N, you must have pleased Sage Truthseeker greatly for him to give you this item. You are also to be granted a gift from his cache of potions; you may choose between 5 superior healing potions or 5 greater mana potions as your reward.

[npctext 32399]
text0_0=Ferocitas and the Gnarlpine Mystics must return what is mine. Please retrieve the emerald so that I may repair my emerald dreamcatcher.

[npctext 32400]
text0_0=Now I can repair my dreamcatcher. Thank you, $N.

[npctext 32401]
text0_0=Ah, so Rellian sent you to aid me. I am glad you arrived here so soon.$b$bI have discovered something quite disturbing!

[npctext 32402]
text0_0=Have you located Oakenscowl yet, $R?

[npctext 32403]
text0_0=I knew you were more than capable of ridding the lake of that horrible beast.$b$bIt is a distressing situation; Oakenscowl was once a grand leader amongst his kind... but corruption does not discriminate between the lowly and the noble.$b$bThe size of this tumor is quite disturbing, but I must study it to learn more about the disease that upsets the timberling population.$b$bThank you, $N.

[npctext 32404]
text0_0=I regret the task that I have asked you to carry out; but Lady Sathrah is beyond hope.$b$bIt is our hope to offer the sacrifice of the spinnerets to Elune. With this sacrifice, Elune will bless Sathrah so that she might be reborn, and at peace.

[npctext 32405]
text0_0=The forest mourns for Lady Sathrah, but it was something that had to be done.$b$bThank you, $N.

[npctext 32406]
text0_0=So, Sister Aquinne sent you?

[npctext 32407]
text0_0=The loss of Lady Sathrah is distressing, but in this way only may she be reborn with a renewed spirit.$b$bMay Elune willingly accept the sacrifice that you have offered her.

[npctext 32408]
text0_0=I have dedicated my life to the search of flawless draenethyst spheres. A lifetime, tau

[npctext 32409]
text0_0=If I can examine the charm, I may be able to figure out how to break the enchantment. Have you found one?

[npctext 32410]
text0_0=Thank you, $N.$b$bWhat an odd trinket this is... I can sense the vile aura emanating from it; this is a very powerful enchantment.

[npctext 32411]
text0_0=I am finally free of the control of the Gnarlpine. Thank you, $N.$b$bMy spirit may now rest peacefully forever in the Emerald Dream.$b$bPerhaps one day we may meet again, young $C. But, for now, please accept this reward as a symbol of my gratitude.

[npctext 32412]
text0_0=You smell foul, $N. Have you been traipsing in sulfur fields? And where are my components?!

[npctext 32413]
text0_0=How do you feel, $N? You radiate with the aura of the snickerfang--your strength, unmatched by mortals!$b$bUnfortunately, with the components you brought to me, I could only make enough of the assay for one tablet. I will require more components, should you require another tablet.

[npctext 32414]
text0_0=Where are the organs, $N!?

[npctext 32415]
text0_0=Where are the organs, $N!?$b$b

[npctext 32416]
text0_0=Fascinating. This has been the most difficult of all assays to analyze.$b$bTake a pinch of this residual salt and place it under your tongue. You should experience a slight feeling of euphoria followed by a state of unprecedented agility and quickness.

[npctext 32417]
text0_0=Where are the organs, $N!?

[npctext 32418]
text0_0=Fine work, $N. Here is one sample of the assay for you and the remaining nine will be used in my research.$b$bAnytime you require more of the ground scorpok assay, return to me and we shall work out a deal.

[npctext 32419]
text0_0=Have you returned with the requested organs?

[npctext 32420]
text0_0=Thrall's Grasp... The story is still fresh in my mind.$b$b<Commander Ruag shakes his head>$b$bTerrible thing that happened to that regiment. The horde lost some of its best soldiers when that battalion was destroyed.

[npctext 32421]
text0_0=Swamp tal... talk.. talker...$b$b

[npctext 32422]
text0_0=Awaiting orders.

[npctext 32423]
text0_0=It is worse than I imagined. Nineteen of my men could have been spared from the agony which they faced. If only I had not acted so irrationally.$b$bYou must help them, $N! I am powerless to act.

[npctext 32424]
text0_0=It is no easy task, $N. Do not give up!

[npctext 32425]
text0_0=You have done it, $N! The poor, tortured souls can finally rest.$b$bOur work is not yet over, $N. We have much to discuss and much more to accomplish.

[npctext 32426]
text0_0=You are temporarily blinded by the sparkle and gleam.

[npctext 32427]
text0_0=Indeed, you have honored us all. Our thanks alone are not sufficient.

[npctext 32428]
text0_0=Trebor? Trebor sent you?

[npctext 32429]
text0_0=This troll tablet must be the "secret" that Rin'ji was talking about.$b$bCovered with strange markings, you can not decipher what the tablet says.$b$bOran Snakewrithe sent you to this area in the first place... Perhaps he might be able to tell you more about it.

[npctext 32430]
text0_0=The demon lord displays a cunning almost as calculated as his brutality, $N.

[npctext 32431]
text0_0=I will help you. Although, I do not think you fully understand what you are up against.

[npctext 32432]
text0_0=What the...?! Don't sneak up on me like that! And keep your voice down! What in the name of the Shadow are doing sneakin' up on me for? Can't you see I'm busy, you daft fool?$b$bWhat do you mean, what am I doing? I'm waiting for the next Dark Portal to open, what the heck do you think I'm doing? Speak your peace and be off with you... 'fore the guards notice the two of us hiding in the bushes together. I have a reputation to maintain.

[npctext 32433]
text0_0=I've been watching Lescovar for a couple weeks now. Trias has never trusted him, but we didn't suspect he was involved in anything to do with the Defias Brotherhood. We were following leads that tied him to the Twilight's Hammer. Either way, he's become more dangerous than this city can deal with, and that's where we come in.$b$bGet me those items and we can put my plan into effect.

[npctext 32434]
text0_0=These will do nicely, $N. Great job.$b$bI have the rest of the gear I'll need in my pack... thank the Light I just got a tailor friend of mine to make me a silk bag. I was running out of room carrying all my gear around.$b$bBefore Spybot heads in, let's get the details set so you know what you have to do.

[npctext 32435]
text0_0=Aturk, like time, waits for no one! Hurry up fool!

[npctext 32436]
text0_0=It seems you are but another complacent lemming of the Warchief, $N. How disappointing.$b$bHow I long for a glorious death upon the battlefield. Instead, I am stuck here, by order of Thrall, to teach infants how to craft! Watch and learn, child!

[npctext 32437]
text0_0=A rare breed your kind be, matey. Let me see that insignia.

[npctext 32438]
text0_0=By Blackhoof's back hair -- finally, one worthy of the Mithril Order!$b$b

[npctext 32439]
text0_0=Hail! Come closer; show Galvan what you have.

[npctext 32440]
text0_0=Ah, many years it has been since one has been worthy of the mithril order's initiation. We will start now!

[npctext 32441]
text0_0=After such mining, your muscles bulge and your body aches!

[npctext 32442]
text0_0=Your work ethic is impeccable, $N! You are starting to understand the ways of Galvan mineralogy! Take this and learn from it all that you can.

[npctext 32443]
text0_0=After such mining, your muscles bulge and your body aches!

[npctext 32444]
text0_0=She's a cruel mistress, is she not, $N? I'm speaking of truesilver, naturally. Aye, Galvan spent over a decade in the mountains of Alterac learning this lesson. Take this and learn from it all that you can!$b$b

[npctext 32445]
text0_0=After such mining, your muscles bulge and your body aches!

[npctext 32446]
text0_0=You appear to have uncovered the wreckage of... a robotic chicken? The voice from within the egg crackles to life again:$b$b"Yes, excellent work! This is indeed my homing robot, though my sensors indicate that it needs a jump start before it can fly back to Booty Bay for repairs. Go ahead and place the beacon inside the rover - the beacon will take care of the rest!"

[npctext 32447]
text0_0=You place the egg... distress beacon... inside the chicken... homing robot.$b$bHums and whirs are heard from inside the robot as it struggles to stand up. After the robot comes to life, Oglethorpe's voice is heard once more, but now from inside the robot:$b$b"OOX-22/FE is working at least, but it needs major repairs! It is much too heavy for you to carry it... but I think I have an idea. Are you up for watching over it some more?"

[npctext 32448]
text0_0=Yes, I'm Oglethorpe Obnoticus, master inventor at your service! Now, is there something I could assist you with?

[npctext 32449]
text0_0=Oh, YOU'RE the great savior of OOX-22/FE! I cannot even begin to express my thanks for your assistance! My homing robot series needs more development, but your recovery has saved me countless hours of extra rebuilding time, as well as many gold pieces in manufacture costs!$b$bPlease, take your choice of any of these items I have. Thank you again for your generous assistance $N, my robots and I are in your debt!

[npctext 32450]
text0_0=Did you find Sergeant Bly? Did you get my divino-matic rod?

[npctext 32451]
text0_0=You found it! Well done, $N! Did you have to fight Bly for it? I hope you knocked him and his band down good and hard!

[npctext 32452]
text0_0=Have you completed the crafting of the items, $N?

[npctext 32453]
text0_0=Excellent! A fair tradeoff, if I do say so myself. Watch and learn, $N!

[npctext 32454]
text0_0=Have you completed the crafting of the items,

[npctext 32455]
text0_0=Have you completed the crafting of the items, $N?

[npctext 32456]
text0_0=Thank you for all that you have taught me, $N. The master and commander of the ornate mithril set will soon be in your possession.$b$bBehold!

[npctext 32457]
text0_0=Yes $C, I am an official of the Gadgetzan Water Company. What can I assist you with?

[npctext 32458]
text0_0=Finally - justice is served! You have struck a mighty blow against those vile nomads! With Scorpidsting's demise, this might be just the thing to finally push those squatters off of Gadgetzan's water wells!$b$bBy the authority of the Gadgetzan Water Company, I gladly award you with this bounty. You've done a great service for us all.

[npctext 32459]
text0_0=Well, now, what is this?

[npctext 32460]
text0_0=This tablet... Quite unusual... Where did you find this, $N?

[npctext 32461]
text0_0=Listen to what I have to say.

[npctext 32462]
text0_0=As a spirit, I am powerless, $N. Assist me. Allow me to regain my honor.

[npctext 32463]
text0_0=Listen to what I have to say, $N.

[npctext 32464]
text0_0=The time to act is now, $N.

[npctext 32465]
text0_0=Were you able to get a stack of ten thick yeti hides? My leather goods are second to none, and I'll share a sampling with you should you have the hides.$b$bIf you can't seem to find yetis, I know where some might be. Try looking west of here, just inland of the Forgotten Coast around the Feral Scar Vale.

[npctext 32466]
text0_0=Ah, excellent! These hides, when given a special treatment, are as resilient as iron I tell you! It will take many tries in order to get the right mix down for the tanning, but I am confident they will bring my mark of quality to the next level.$b$bAs for you, $N... your assistance has proven invaluable to me. Please take your choice from these items I have crafted.

[npctext 32467]
text0_0=I don't see any blueprints. Did you hide them somewhere on your body or are you just standing around here to irritate me?$b$b

[npctext 32468]
text0_0=She's a beauty, isn't she? Pinnacle of goblin transport technology -- only exploded a dozen or so times.$b$bDon't worry, $N, I've got her all fixed up. She won't blow up on you - and if she does, it'll be quick and painless.

[npctext 32469]
text0_0=Do you have the tiara, $N? Has Velratha learned the price of crossing me?

[npctext 32470]
text0_0=Wonderful! You found it! And what's just as important--Velratha no longer has it! Thank you, $N. I am forever in your debt!$b$bAnd if I sounded a little... mean before, pay it no mind. You'll find me a much nicer person to those who haven't stolen from me.

[npctext 32471]
text0_0=We must be clear; you shall be apprenticed to me while you learn the art of Wild Leather armor. Because wildvines are both potent and chaotic, it yields a random but strong benefit to the already strong armor you will be making. This knowledge, however, was not easy for me to acquire.$b$bThe initial cost to begin this process is ten pieces of thick leather.$b$bOnce that is done, we'll get to the work you need to do in order to obtain the patterns.

[npctext 32472]
text0_0=Well $N, I'm glad to have you on board as my apprentice. You've made a wise decision as a leatherworker; those who make use of leather armor will be clamoring to you once you learn how to master the art of Wild Leather.$b$bLet's get to work - where do you want to start?

[npctext 32473]
text0_0=Do you have the six thick armor kits and the wildvine I require?$b$bThink of making armor kits as a lesson in steady and reliable crafting; the consistent fashioning method you develop as you ply your trade on these kits helps develop your skills for the intricate work needed to make Wild Leather armors.$b$bEvery lesson has a purpose, $N. It is important to embrace each one accordingly.

[npctext 32474]
text0_0=These armor kits are of solid quality, $N. If there is one thing I demand in not only my work, but in the work of those I give tutelage to, it is quality.$b$bYou've done well to earn this pattern; I hope it brings you the rewards it has brought me.

[npctext 32475]
text0_0=Do you have the two Turtle Scale breastplates and gloves? Also, don't forget the wildvine!$b$bEven with the earliest patterns, we learn that the fundamentals of shape translate well into more difficult garments. Though different items, the shape of the Turtle Scale breastplates prepares you for the detailing needed to make a Wild Leather vest.$b$bAs you progress through your lessons, the skills I teach will become as art.

[npctext 32476]
text0_0=These are some very nice pieces here, $N. The craftsmanship and care put in to making these show you have chosen to dedicate yourself fully to these tasks.$b$bYou've met my requests, and with that comes your reward. The knowledge of making Wild Leather vests is now yours!

[npctext 32477]
text0_0=I need those tunics and headbands made, and I also need that piece of wildvine before I will share with you the knowledge of Wild Leather helmets.$b$bHead gear is highly coveted amongst adventurers, whether it be a disarmingly simple headband or a full-covering helmet. The fundamentals of creating valued head gear remain constant, no matter what the cosmetic appearance of the gear is.

[npctext 32478]
text0_0=This Nightscape equipment you have supplied perfectly meets the requirements I have given to you, $N. I expect no less from a leatherworker of your caliber.$b$bYou have earned the honor of crafting Wild Leather helmets. I give this pattern to you freely, and hope you will profit from it accordingly.

[npctext 32479]
text0_0=The pants, boots, and wildvines need to be delivered to me before you learn the pattern, $N. Have you done as I asked?$b$bFrom the earliest pair of boots we learn how to make, we start to understand that a quality boot needs to ride a razor's edge between comfort and function. With both, we are able to create items that allow the wearer to ignore fatigue that would cripple those wearing lower quality goods.

[npctext 32480]
text0_0=Once again, you have produced items with the skill of a seasoned professional. You have earned this pattern, as well as my congratulations.

[npctext 32481]
text0_0=Do you have the Turtle Scale bracers and helms ready? Don't forget the two wildvines I require.$b$bBy now, you're starting to realize the potential power that lies in Wild Leather armor. An armor that has no boundaries in application is nearly invaluable to a leatherworker. The limits are only in the quantities of resources to make the items - not the quality of the finished products!

[npctext 32482]
text0_0=Again, you've completed my task without flaw. Perhaps some day I will come to YOU seeking knowledge, eh $N?$b$bHere is the pattern for the leggings, along with my thanks. Commit this lore to your knowledge, and let your finished products tap into your impressive skills!

[npctext 32483]
text0_0=Greetings, troll... from your countenance I can tell you are a leatherworker as am I. Have you come to draw from my skills, or perhaps you have other business with me?

[npctext 32484]
text0_0=Ah yes, Jangdor sent you. I am pleased to see that one of my finest students now has a student of his own.$b$bHis dedication and his talents with leather are impressive. For him to compliment you so in this letter, it is a sign of respect I acknowledge.$b$bI am aware that he has taught you the art of Wild Leather. Allow me to finish your training with this pattern. Make good use of it; few in the world know the secrets of Wild Leather cloaks.

[npctext 32485]
text0_0=That's right. I do have a bone to pick with a troll. A few bones. All her bones!$b$bWant to help me?

[npctext 32486]
text0_0=We drive them back, and yet they still attack! Someone or something must be driving them into a frenzy... oh, you have returned, eh $N? Do you have the manes I require for the bounty to be met?

[npctext 32487]
text0_0=This is proof of a good start, $N. Your skills as a soldier are to be commended.$b$bYou are not the only one I ask that task of. Many before you have fought them, and in times past our efforts have kept them at bay. Recently though, their attempts to push northward into our area of influence have increased dramatically. Their attacks have also become more savage... almost as if they were desperate.$b$bI have a plan though, $N, that might settle things once and for all against them...

[npctext 32488]
text0_0=You've done as I have asked, and for that I salute you. Take this small reward as compensation for your efforts, $N.$b$bWith their numbers thinned and their leaders slain, the gnolls will think twice about storming the camp. This doesn't conclude the issue at hand, however...$b$bThere must be some reason why the gnolls have been whipped into such a frenzied state. Before they have a chance to regroup though, I want to find out what is causing it.

[npctext 32489]
text0_0=Ah, so you've been speaking with MacKinley, have you?$b$bIt's not what he thinks! I'm not afraid to give him some Steamwheedle Bilge Rum...$b$bI just don't have any rum to give him!

[npctext 32490]
text0_0=Did you find my shipment of rum, $N?

[npctext 32491]
text0_0=Great, thanks for the shipment! Now MacKinley and I can finally settle our wager.

[npctext 32492]
text0_0=Did Stoley cough up my booze?

[npctext 32493]
text0_0=Hm, let's try this...$b$bI can't believe it! This stuff is... terrible! That's great!$b$bWell I guess Stoley can keep the money he owes me. He's true to his word about Steamwheedle bilge rum. That stuff is as thick as gravel and burns like lava!

[npctext 32494]
text0_0=You look a little dazed. Have you been reading our legal documents?

[npctext 32495]
text0_0=Ah, Andre's head. So I guess he'll make his trial after all!$b$bMuch appreciated, $N. Now if you'll just sign here, I can issue you payment for services rendered.$b$bDon't worry about the small print. It's harmless, and... I don't think there's a magnifying glass small enough to read it anyway.

[npctext 32496]
text0_0=Examining the map reveals it to be the battle plans that Hadoken Swiftstrider wants. Numerous arrows that perhaps represent troop movements are drawn on the map, though most seem to be headed toward the south rather than to the north where Camp Mojache lies.$b$bAnother section of the map has a picture of what you think is a large insect of some kind, with various tick marks under it. From the looks of the gnolls, it perhaps represents their losses against the unknown bugs...

[npctext 32497]
text0_0=Welcome back $N - were you able to find some tangible evidence as to the plans of the gnolls?

[npctext 32498]
text0_0=Ah, this is exactly what we needed. While I am not so skilled at ciphering what most of the scrawling on this map is, I've seen enough battle plans in my day to understand what is happening with the gnolls. It looks like they are currently fighting a two front war. One is with us... but it seems that their main energy has been against a foe to their south.$b$bThere's more at hand here than meets the eye. Perhaps it is time to figure out who this other foe they face really is.

[npctext 32499]
text0_0=Yes it's true. Techbot has gone $C! Please, can you help me?

[npctext 32500]
text0_0=Can't you see we're trying to cure an entire species of gnomes here??! We need more of the green glow!

[npctext 32501]
text0_0=Excellent work! The time has come to test the new formula. If this works, not only should that captured leper gnome be cured, but I should have a full head of hair! Stand back!

[npctext 32502]
text0_0=If this were a race, you would have lost by now.

[npctext 32503]
text0_0=You have not completed my task, $N.

[npctext 32504]
text0_0=Word reached me of your deed. A grim deed, but one of honor. Let us hope the Witherbarks heed your message.

[npctext 32505]
text0_0=Hello, gentle $C. The day has been long and not a single experiment successful...I hope you bring good news to me.

[npctext 32506]
text0_0=Ah, and what is this? It appears to be venom... from some arachnoid creature I deem. And where did you get it?

[npctext 32507]
text0_0=Do you have the undamaged venom sac, $N? I yearn to run experiments with its fresh venom, and have ordered a collection of small, terribly cute animals on which to test it!

[npctext 32508]
text0_0=Oh, splendid! The venom is quite fresh and I'm sure very deadly. Thank you!

[npctext 32509]
text0_0=Ah, so you want fresh venom from the spider of the witherbarks, yes? Well, sit down... you're not going to like what I have to tell you.

[npctext 32510]
text0_0=Ah, Elortha no Shadra... speak this name only in whispers, for its utterance carries much weight in the realms of the spirit.$b$bI will put it to parchment and create for you a spell of summoning...

[npctext 32511]
text0_0=Did you get the venom?

[npctext 32512]
text0_0=Sweet, you got it!

[npctext 32513]
text0_0=Word was sent of your coming, $N. You have a parcel for me?

[npctext 32514]
text0_0=Ah, very good. Lydon mentioned the poison in this parcel is the most potent he has come in contact with, and is busy working on new applications with it.$b$bWith luck, we will find many.$b$bThank you, $N. Your service to the Royal Apothecary Society is undeniable.

[npctext 32515]
text0_0=Oh, so Troyas Moonbreeze sent you?$b$b<mutters>...always bothering me with his wild notions that he found something important...$b$bLook, $N, I'll be blunt. Troyas always thinks he has found something important in those ruins. The truth is, anything that was truly valuable was probably hoarded away long ago by the ogres or the harpies that now reside there.$b$bYou're welcome to take a look around, but I don't know if you'll find any books here that will help you.

[npctext 32516]
text0_0=So, you'd like to borrow Feralas: A History?$b$bLet me think...$b$bI will allow you to borrow this book, $N, but only if you do something for me first.

[npctext 32517]
text0_0=A letter -- for me?

[npctext 32518]
text0_0=Are you another one of Daryn's interns? She's quite a knowledgeable historian, $N. You should be grateful to be studying under her leadership.$b$bNow, let me get the Super Snapper FX. You're gonna love it!

[npctext 32519]
text0_0=This familiar looking pedestal sticks out of the hot sand. Perhaps there is something to its presence here...

[npctext 32520]
text0_0=As you touch the pedestal, the miniature discs from Uldaman hum and glow in your backpack. A familiar feeling tingle washes over your hands, as the image of another Stone Watcher springs to life in front of the gates of Uldum.$b$b"Salutations. I am a guardian of entry. The discs that have been used for access are missing the correct entry discs, the Plates of Uldum. Please incorporate these plates with the disc structure and repeat your access sequencing. Thank you."

[npctext 32521]
text0_0=The stone watcher's voice resonates with power and authority:$b$b"Your discs will be returned to you once you access the pedestal. When you have obtained the Plates of Uldum and incorporated them into your existing disc set, you may then enter the complex."

[npctext 32522]
text0_0=We're all in agreement then - the best course of action is to wait until we can narrow down the areas where these plates might lie hidden. You've brought us this far $N, and I hope you will be the one to head back in to the field to confront the secrets of Uldum.$b$bAllow me to give you this honorarium in the meantime; this should cover any expenses you've encountered in assisting us, and a little something extra. Be sure to check back with us soon... Uldum beckons us all, young one.

[npctext 32523]
text0_0=The sprite darters can be dangerous critters when provoked. Be careful when dealing with them, $C. And be even more careful of any night elves in the area. The pestering fools tend to hold up in the forests also.$b$bWhen you've gotten enough of the wings, let me know, I'll be sure to reward you well!

[npctext 32524]
text0_0=Wonderful, $C! These will do nicely. There are enough here to make a cloak for Korrin, and possibly even more! Thank you.$b$bI hope the trip wasn't too dangerous? The area of Feralas is not known for being forgiving, but you've obviously done well enough.$b$bThank you again, $C.

[npctext 32525]
text0_0=Take my words seriously, $C, the Grimtotem clan is evil. If you've found their whereabouts, then it's up to you to return and strike the first blow against their clan... before they can come into our own lands and raze our own villages, or pilfer our lands.

[npctext 32526]
text0_0=These are good horns, $C. Well done. I'll take these from you and be sure to tell Belgrom as soon as we return to Orgrimmar. You've helped me twice now, and for that, you have my mark. Perhaps in the future I can help you! Good luck to you.

[npctext 32527]
text0_0=Move swiftly, $N. Or is the task I requested too difficult?

[npctext 32528]
text0_0=Excellent, $N. In time, the land will heal. We must not give up.

[npctext 32529]
text0_0=Be quick, $C, I have much to complete today.

[npctext 32530]
text0_0=The Grimtotem!? This is interesting. You say you came across them while hunting in Feralas? Truly?$b$bMy peers will want to hear your news, $C. Tell me more and I'll count out your coin while you do so.$b$bAnd before you go, know that I give you thanks for the information you've passed on to me this day.

[npctext 32531]
text0_0=What is this?

[npctext 32532]
text0_0=This scroll... You found this in the Gordunni Outpost?

[npctext 32533]
text0_0=We must discover more about why the Gordunni are here, $N.

[npctext 32534]
text0_0=This orb will provide us with more information about the Gordunni... which we will then use in planning their downfall, $N.

[npctext 32535]
text0_0=You have proven yourself to be a trustworthy and dependable ally, $N.

[npctext 32536]
text0_0=Hmmm, Narm sent you to me, did he?$b$bWell then, Narm could always be trusted, so that must mean you're ready to take part of the next sapta--the sapta of fire.$b$bI see it in your eyes already, the burning, the desire. You've tasted power, and now you're ready for more of it. Patience, $N. Remember what earth taught you. Power and destruction will come easily, but you must still know when to stay your hand.

[npctext 32537]
text0_0=Hmmm, Narm sent you to me, did he?$b$bWell then, Narm could always be trusted, so that must mean you're ready to take part of the next sapta--the sapta of fire.$b$bI see it in your eyes already, the burning, the desire. You've tasted power, and now you're ready for more of it. Patience, $N. Remember what earth taught you. Power and destruction will come easily, but you must still know when to stay your hand.

[npctext 32538]
text0_0=The wind approaches you quickly from the horizon; the earth is steady beneath your feet; and your spirit is already warmed by fire--I would say it is time for you to learn about the purity of water.$b$bYour path has led you this far, and your spirit will give you the strength to carry on even further. But the first step is yours to take.

[npctext 32539]
text0_0=Get on up there and start digging!$b$bI've got places to go and people to see -- time is money!

[npctext 32540]
text0_0=Perfect! I will take these along as I continue my travels, $N. I'm sure I can find someone that will pay a pretty penny for this cobalt.$b$bHere, take this for your trouble.

[npctext 32541]
text0_0=What have you brought me, $R?

[npctext 32542]
text0_0=Fascinating, $N...$b$bThis orb is very powerful, but also very dangerous.

[npctext 32543]
text0_0=Did you bring me the temper, $N?

[npctext 32544]
text0_0=Ah, this is very nice temper indeed! And so much of it! I'll be at work for days before I use it all!$b$bThank you, $N. Please, take this as payment.

[npctext 32545]
text0_0=The hate that Edana spreads across the land must be stopped.

[npctext 32546]
text0_0=Now I know that Edana is truly dead. This heart; I will keep it in memory of what did here for me, $N. Thank you.

[npctext 32547]
text0_0=Thank you, $N. You have put an old tauren's mind at peace.

[npctext 32548]
text0_0=Another $R to bolster the ranks. Good enough for me.$b$bYou'll probably have a hard time hefting a good weapon like an axe, but a spear's just as good as anything else.$b$bWelcome to the Valley of Trials.

[npctext 32549]
text0_0=You'll find this place fitting as you continue to train in the $C ways. If you have any questions, feel free to ask anyone around, and when you feel you're ready, come back to me for training. I've mastered as much as any $C here in the Valley and can pass that knowledge on to you... for a price.

[npctext 32550]
text0_0=Jen'shan see a mighty $C before her and da spirits approve.$b$bDa path of da $C is one of our oldest walks of life. Da Horde turned to us when they be just strugglin' to survive on Azeroth, and they ask us to teach them, to show them the secrets of many tings. They were strong already: strong in $C ways; strong in $C ways. But the $C path not be their path... then.

[npctext 32551]
text0_0=Now we teach them those things, and they teach us others. We become one race... almost. We be allies for long time now. So you remember to help them. And Jen'shan remember to help you.$b$bJen'shan teach you da ways of the $C--teach you good. You never forget, $C's be respected greatly by da tribe. You be havin' a large role to play in da future... you never forget that.$b$bWhen you feel da need, come to Jen'shan. She teach you as much as she can when she feel you ready.

[npctext 32552]
text0_0=Welcome to the Valley of Trials, Rangrang. You wouldn't be here if you hadn't gotten my tablet, so I will get to the point.$b$bI am Rwag and I am responsible for training the rogues, thieves, and cutpurses here in the Valley. I'm the one the Hand will turn to if you're not ready for what's to come. But don't worry, the Hand won't be controlling everything you do, but it would be wise to work with them if they have need of your talents.

[npctext 32553]
text0_0=Until such time comes, you'll be under my tutelage. I will show you the ropes as some folks say. Whenever you feel prepared, come to me and I will see about training you further. Until then, practice your skills and keep them honed to a razor's edge. You'll never know when you'll need even the most insignificant ability.

[npctext 32554]
text0_0=Ah, welcome, $N. I'm pleased you have arrived. My days have become long and even busy what with so many students to teach, but the coming of one of your ilk brings me a great sense of accomplishment--I remember the days when I was taught by one of your shamans.

[npctext 32555]
text0_0=As you probably know, the elements give us our power. Fire, earth, water and air--these are our tools.$b$bOur strength comes from the spirits of our ancestors. We are the leaders of our people. Like Thrall is to the Horde, so shall we be to the villages and towns we visit. They will look to us for wisdom and protection. To be better prepared, you must train often. When you feel you've gained more power, come to me and I shall teach you what I can.

[npctext 32556]
text0_0=Shhh, not so loud. I don't trust Nartok over there. Anyone that has to hide deeper in a cave than I do shouldn't be trifled with.$b$bI trust you had no problem finding your way around?

[npctext 32557]
text0_0=Now that you know where I'm holding up, I should let you know: the Shattered Hand's asked me to look out for you. They want me to train you and keep you informed of anything they might need. Even if you're not interested in helping them yet--which you'd be a fool not to be--I'll do what I can to train you... for a small fee. Come back to me anytime you think you're ready, and we'll see what you're ready to learn.

[npctext 32558]
text0_0=Finally, you've arrived... and discretely also. Good.$b$bOur world is full of fools, Asatokta. Even the mighty Thrall has greater flaws than most can see. He turns his back on the power needed to make this land ours completely! We're not the same people who were manipulated and used by creatures from the Nether. We are our own people. We are proud... and we are strong.

[npctext 32559]
text0_0=And now you've joined our ranks also. Don't misunderstand, Asatokta. Just because you have access to power that many will be jealous of, it does not mean you will be accepted easily. Thrall allows our kind into Orgrimmar because we are still his fellow kin--he cannot turn his back on us, or we would become as pathetic as the humans who enslaved him. My point is: be careful. You can be powerful, but if you are foolish, then you are as good dead.$b$bIf you need training in spells then return to me.

[npctext 32560]
text0_0=Ah, at last, you've arrived, $C. I did not lie in my note, $N. We are a special breed also, not unlike the druids or shamans of our tribe. You are just as important. We are the ones called upon to defend our borders, to hunt the centaur, and to go to war.

[npctext 32561]
text0_0=Each of us plays a role in our tribe. Each of us must also go through all the same rites. Do not ever let your pride tell you otherwise.$b$bI remain here to train new warriors that seek the glory of battle and who follow the ways of our oldest ancestors. When you feel ready, come back to me and I will do what I can to train you further. Go with the tribe's blessing, $N.

[npctext 32562]
text0_0=Welcome to Camp Narache, Clisha. I hear good things about you. Your bloodline is strong, and many of the elders consider you skilled already. But that we will test.$b$bThe plains of Mulgore will be your home for sometime--you should do your best to learn it very well. One day you will travel to unfamilar lands to master greater skills. You must be ready.

[npctext 32563]
text0_0=And it is my job to make sure you are prepared by teaching you the basics of our profession--how to tame your pet, how to fire your rifle, and many other skills that will become necessary.$b$bHunters are a strong part of our tradition and history, Clisha. You would do well to remember how important you are to the tribe. You will be respected and revered if you serve our people well.

[npctext 32564]
text0_0=As quickly as water falls from the sky, here you are before me. I am pleased by your haste. It means you realize both the importance of our meeting and you being here. I am no leader, but I do understand the elements, and I can speak to the spirits of our people. I will teach you to do the same.

[npctext 32565]
text0_0=We will meet many times in the days to come. Each time you will hopefully leave my company a little more powerful... a little more prepared. Like the Eternal Flame, your spirit will burn bright and hot.$b$bGo now, $N. Go and test yourself. I will be here for you when you need.

[npctext 32566]
text0_0=You have arrived. This is good. Our ancestors' spirits have become restless throughout Mulgore and beyond, but I cannot tell why. It will forever be your duty to learn to listen to nature's spirits, and act as their avatar. Be mindful of that.

[npctext 32567]
text0_0=Though we share a common bond, do not expect much welcome from the night elves. Their pride still limits their sight, but that is none of our concern. The teachings of the Earthmother are all you must concern yourself with, and I will teach you what I know as you grow in wisdom.$b$bReturn to me often, $N. You will find that the Earthmother grants incredible abilities to those who are most dedicated.

[npctext 32568]
text0_0=Ah, so you've arrived. Good. I overheard that a few others were able to escape "death" and were heading into town. Perhaps that resilence will pay off in the future also.$b$bYou may thank Sylvanas for your freedom... freedom of mind and body. Though you still remain tortured by the plague and its effects, you are now free to come and go as you see fit.

[npctext 32569]
text0_0=I will be here to train you as you grow in experience... find me as often as you like. I charge a minimal fee, but you'll find everything I can teach you to be worthwhile.$b$bGo now and test your skill. Many more things will become known to you as you gain experience, some of which I am unable to discuss with you here. Just know that Sylvanas will need warriors with your type of strength in the future. You will be the backbone of our salvation. Do not forget it.

[npctext 32570]
text0_0=So you've made it? Good, we'll have need of more rogues as time goes on. The Shadowstalkers will probably wind up finding you when they think the time's right, so don't go and slip up or do anything you might regret. They need talented agents... not pickpockets and fools.

[npctext 32571]
text0_0=I spend most of my time here in the inn keeping an eye out for new faces and just keeping tabs on up-and-coming prospects. Keep your nose clean and I'll do what I can to teach you a few things. Just come back to me whenever you want, and we'll see if you're ready for a new skill or two.

[npctext 32572]
text0_0=Ah, so between fire, plague, rioting, and much worse, one more of the "faithful" comes to my door. Well, let me bid you welcome, $C. And allow me a moment to explain a thing or two before you decide it's time for you to seek whatever drives you forward: the Holy Light no longer concerns you, the spirits of your forefathers are fairy tales, and creatures from the Nether don't want you.$b$bDo you understand me so far?

[npctext 32573]
text0_0=There is only one thing you must know: we have survived through will alone. It is faith in ourselves that separates us from others, and with our powers, we will cause great change in all of Azeroth. The weak will come to lean on you. The lepers will call you Lord. And the ignorant will look to you for guidance. It is my duty to make sure you have the necessary tools so when the time comes, you are prepared. As you grow in experience, seek me out. I will teach you greater powers if you are ready.

[npctext 32574]
text0_0=I knew you would come to me, $N. Not because you do not have the will to follow your own path, but because we are kindred spirits. We both have felt pain. We have both suffered. And now we want the power to take back what we know is ours: this land, our lives, our destinies. But there is much for you to learn still.

[npctext 32575]
text0_0=You must return to me often if you are to become powerful enough to destroy those who would oppose us. The rules of magic still apply to you, $N. You will still find corruption follows you like hungry wolves in the night. You will find its caress is not unlike an addiction, an old lover still wanting to be by your side. But these things can be staved off. These things will only control you if you allow them to.$b$bGo now, return to me when you've grown more powerful.

[npctext 32576]
text0_0=I bid you welcome, sister. I knew you would come. It was only a matter of time.$b$bWhat I said interested you, didn't it? I hit a chord... something inside you knew what I claimed was truth. Good.$b$bKnow this though: I am no traitor to Sylvanas. If anything, she would appreciate my claims considering it was her own beliefs that has put the Forsaken in the position it is now.

[npctext 32577]
text0_0=I mentioned a slave still being a slave, no matter the master. Do you remember? We both know that it is that type of control--that type of power--that now drives us. We seek to have creatures serve us. We know we are more powerful and deserve more respect than others give us ... and so now we look to take it.$b$bI will be your ally in this struggle--the struggle for our own freedom. Freedom to seek our own allegiances. When you feel ready, return to me and I will teach you all I know.

[npctext 32578]
text0_0=Finally! We meet face to face, brother to brother. I welcome you to Northshire. This will be your home for a short time while you learn the ins and outs of how things are done, but know that Stormwind is not far off, and sooner or later, your path will take you there. But until then, be patient... Knight of the Silver Hand.

[npctext 32579]
text0_0=In the meantime, you should know one or two other things. You are a symbol to many here in this land--act accordingly. The Holy Light shines within you, and it will be obvious to both your allies and your enemies.$b$bAlso, as you gain in wisdom and power, you will need to train to learn new abilities. That's where I come in. When you feel you've gained some experience here in Northshire, come back to me and I will teach you what I feel you are ready to learn. Good luck... $C!

[npctext 32580]
text0_0=You made it here in one piece, and it doesn't look like too many people saw you. Good enough for me. I don't like to have much attention drawn to me back here... nice and quiet. I'm sure you can understand.$b$bHave any trouble yet? I'm glad to hear not. That'll change soon enough.

[npctext 32581]
text0_0=You're gonna find that there a number of outfits that'll covet our skills, Cailel. Adventurers, SI:7... heck, even the Defias Brotherhood wouldn't mind a spy or two inside Stormwind. But you remember this, you're your own man. Don't let nobody bully you into doing something you don't wanna do! Besides, we hold all the cards... at least, we do before the game's done. Know what I mean?$b$bAnyway, just wanted to introduce myself and let you know that I'm here if you need any training. Come by anytime.

[npctext 32582]
text0_0=Ah, at last you've come. I knew you would find your way to me. The Holy Light shines upon you, and the path you've chosen. These times are harsh--the Burning Legion still has a presence upon Azeroth, the entirety of Kalimdor seeks new ways to defend itself from its own tribulations, and it is up to you to aid as many as you can.

[npctext 32583]
text0_0=As you grow in experience, return to me and I will do what I can to impart my knowledge upon you. Until then, go with compassion in your heart, and let wisdom be your guide. Remember, the world only becomes a better place if you make it so.

[npctext 32584]
text0_0=Blast it's cold today, aint it? It's like the snow never goes away, $N.$b$bYou've probably noticed already, but there are gnomes now living in our city. That's because they went and got themselves blown out of their own home. Don't go spreadin' this 'round, but I can hardly blame them--I think I woulda resorted to explosives too if Ironforge were infested with Dark Irons or the like.

[npctext 32585]
text0_0=Other things you'll probably see too, just so yer in the know: dwarves usin' magic in a fight 'stead of a rifle. Some of us takin' to worshippin' the Holy Light like some of the humans, and, last but not least, troggs. You'll learn more 'bout them later, but What you need to know now is that I'm here to help ya.$b$bI be here to teach ya how to be a real $C. Anytime ya think ya need more trainin', come back to me and I'll see what I can do.

[npctext 32586]
text0_0=So, you've made it! And not a second too soon. There's much to be done in Coldridge Valley and beyond. I'm gonna need your help as much as you're gonna need mine!$b$bYou're a Knight of the Silver Hand now, be ready to play the part.

[npctext 32587]
text0_0=The humans have taught us a great deal about the Holy Light and how important their order is to them... and to protecting all of Azeroth. We have a great respect for how stepped in tradition it is, and how just one figure, one sacrifice, can make the difference between pain and salvation.$b$bThe two of us are gonna be working together for a bit. Any time you think you're ready, come back to me and we'll see about getting you some training. Can't have you go out into the world unprepared, now, can we?

[npctext 32588]
text0_0=You made it! Great!$b$bWe've got an influx of activity lately, so I'm glad to count another of the Ironforge clan among our numbers. Too many of us are lookin' to the arcane, and divine for my own tastes. Nothin' against them and their beliefs, but there's nothing like a cold blade in your hand and a shadow to keep you from the light, know what I mean?

[npctext 32589]
text0_0=Anyway, as you start peekin' around Coldridge you'll probably have need of training at some point. You just come back to me whenever you feel you need it and I'll teach you what I know--a trick here, a maneuver there. You know, the stuff that keeps you alive and makin' a little extra coin.$b$bKeep an eye out on our gnomish friends too... they kinda got the short end of the stick what with Gnomeregan being... destroyed. They'll need our help to feel welcome.

[npctext 32590]
text0_0=Glad to see you got my note and came over. Sorry about pretendin' it was a memorandum from your higher-ups... no offense intended. I just knew the two of us, along with others of our kind, gotta stick together.$b$bNot many think it's the best thing in the world to have your kind and my kind holed up in the same city, but I think we can work things out just fine. What do you think?

[npctext 32591]
text0_0=I pretty much keep to myself around here so we don't get a bad wrap for things gone missing, but if you need anything, some training or somethin', just come back anytime.$b$bYou and me got an understandin'. We know when it comes down to it you can only trust family... and that's just what we got going on here, isn't it? Regardless of Gnomeregan being... overrun, and whatever else is thrown our way, we got one another to back each other up. Right?

[npctext 32592]
text0_0=Yeah, what's that, $R? Speak up, if you don't mind. I don't hear so good after a few ales.

[npctext 32593]
text0_0=Oh, yeah! Arcane Arts... of course.$b$bHere's what you need to know, $N: Don't get into too much trouble. Save some coin to buy me an ale... or any spells ya might want. And stay the heck away from Gnomeregan. Other than that, have a good day! I'll be here if you need me or want to train... or whatever.

[npctext 32594]
text0_0=Wonderful! You got my memorandum obviously.$b$bIgnore the fools around you, Anengineer. The Holy Light?! The sword and shield?! These aren't paths for ones as open minded as us. Look at what "normal" magic did to our home. Coupled with those damned tinkerers, our race almost became extinct. And now we have to rely on the dwarves-- they'd rather spend time allying with humans than help us rebuild our own home. We're like second-class citizens. Have you seen the way they look at us?

[npctext 32595]
text0_0=But none of that matters. What matters is that you've seen your own Holy Light! You know where power truly comes from. You realize that having our own allies is much more... prudent. Special allies. Allies that, no matter the task, will obey till their last breath.$b$bAnd that's where I come in, Anengineer. I can train you in the beginnings of those special powers. Seek me out often and I will do what I can to teach you more spells.

[npctext 32596]
text0_0=You made it. I'm so glad.$b$bMuch has happened over the last few years, Saric: the creation of Teldrassil, the corruption of many of the forest creatures here and abroad, discovery of lands we thought lost to us like Feralas... so much, in so little time. But those are just some of the reasons we are here, the most important being to protect our kind from further evil.

[npctext 32597]
text0_0=Soon you will see others from different races in the boughs of our home--do not let it cause any prejudice within you. They are welcome. They will aid us when they can. Not all of them will be altruistic, but they should be granted some amount of trust.$b$bBut none of this matters now. Now we must focus on you, and how you can aid our people. I am here for that very purpose. I will train you in the ways of a $C as you become stronger. Return to me whenever you wish and I will do what I can to aid you.

[npctext 32598]
text0_0=You've arrived, and none too soon, Snowdogchar. Welcome to Shadowglen.$b$bI trust my sigil found you in good spirits and health?$b$bAs I said previously, I am here to train you as a $C; to tame beasts to aid you in battle; to use a bow with unerring accuracy; to respect the lands which we call home and also the lands beyond.

[npctext 32599]
text0_0=As you experience what Shadowglen has to teach you, come see me--I will be able to help you understand more about your role as a $C and what you are capable of.$b$bThese are dangerous times, Snowdogchar, do not take for granted the skill of your pets--there are things in this world more dangerous than you can imagine. Go with Elune and return to me again.

[npctext 32600]
text0_0=Hello, Ferlis. I'm glad you found me. I was thinking that perhaps you got lost on the way here.$b$bNothing really new has happened in Shadowglen since I sent you my sigil, but I'll leave all the information gathering to you. Speak to the rest of the people around Aldrassil if you'd like.

[npctext 32601]
text0_0=Until then, know that our kind are needed more than ever in this tenuous time. Peace with the other races can fail at any moment, and there is much talk about members of the Horde looking to sow even greater seeds of distrust. Remember that.$b$bAs you gain in power and feel more prepared, come back to me here and I will see about getting you some training. It's important that you know how to handle your weapon of choice, among other things.

[npctext 32602]
text0_0=It pleases me to see you've arrived so quickly, $N. Welcome.$b$bAs you've probably heard, all of Teldrassil is stirring with the comings and goings of travelers. Even members of the Alliance have even been allowed access onto Teldrassil's boughs in order to meet with other Kaldorei who prepare for the adventures ahead.

[npctext 32603]
text0_0=Do not concern yourself with the world below Teldrassil for now. There will be time for that later. Go now and speak to the others in Shadowglen--they can tell you more about what events have transpired. Help them in any way you can, and anytime you feel you need more training, come back to me and I will teach you what I can.

[npctext 32604]
text0_0=Ah, young $C. I see you're eager to continue your studies. Good.$b$bI wonder, have you spent much time in the Emerald Dream already? Perhaps you're not prepared for that yet... In time, I'm sure.$b$bBut until then, we should discuss other matters.

[npctext 32605]
text0_0=I will be your mentor and guide for now. It is my duty to teach you how to interpret not only what the spirits communicate to us, but also the complexities and secrets of the Emerald Dream.$b$bAs you learn and grow in power, you will learn more of our sleeping trance. But until then, return to me as often as you like and I will teach you what I can in the ways of our kind.

[npctext 32606]
text0_0=Yes?

[npctext 32607]
text0_0=I have been waiting for Uzer'i to deliver this...$b$bLet me give you the herb mixture I prepared for his... well, experiments...

[npctext 32608]
text0_0=Have you spoken to Neeru?

[npctext 32609]
text0_0=This is just what I need to prepare the muisek vessel, $N. Soon we will see if my latest incantations prove to be as powerful as I had hoped.$b$bPlease, a moment. I must perform the ritual and apply the herbs.

[npctext 32610]
text0_0=Were you able to capture the wildkin?$b$bIf you succeed, we will be ready to shrink and capture the muisek of creatures of Feralas.

[npctext 32611]
text0_0=Upon a violent death, the muisek of a creature may escape and seek revenge. Shrinking the creatures, as you did, $N, prevents the muisek from escaping. Now we may use it as we please!

[npctext 32612]
text0_0=Were you able to capture the hippogryphs?

[npctext 32613]
text0_0=After killing an animal, if we allowed the muisek to escape, it may take the form of an even greater creature. We would never be safe from its vengeance.$b$bThis is a dangerous job I have given you, $N. Again, you have completed it well.

[npctext 32614]
text0_0=Were you able to capture the muisek of the faerie dragons?

[npctext 32615]
text0_0=Thank you, $N. Now the spiritual powers of the faerie dragon will be available to us.$b$bI hope you willing to perform another task for me.

[npctext 32616]
text0_0=Were you able to capture the wandering forest walkers?

[npctext 32617]
text0_0=Thank you, $N. Our muisek collection is almost complete.

[npctext 32618]
text0_0=Were you able to capture the mountain giants?

[npctext 32619]
text0_0=Just imagine the possibilities of what we now possess, $N. Along with the materials that you have collected, I will be able to forever trap the muisek of these creatures into whatever I wish.

[npctext 32620]
text0_0=Were you able to collect the materials I need?

[npctext 32621]
text0_0=Excellent! These materials, combined with the muisek, should yield just the results we've been wanting.

[npctext 32622]
text0_0=As promised, you have your choice, $N. The muisek of the creatures has been forever sealed into the power of these weapons.$b$bYou may now wield their energy as your own. Use it well.

[npctext 32623]
text0_0=So be it...

[npctext 32624]
text0_0=Ah, very good. There is a matter regarding the wolf hearts you brought to me earlier that demands our attention.

[npctext 32625]
text0_0=Oh goodness $N, this town is not well suited for the likes of me. There are as many nasty creatures here as there were in Gnomeregan before the accident!$b$bDo you have my belongings? If you don't, then who knows what the trolls have done with them now...

[npctext 32626]
text0_0=Huzzah, you've found them! You're an absolute savior, my friend. Here, it's not much, but it's something for the trouble I've put you through! Thank you!

[npctext 32627]
text0_0=They're that big? I might have to rethink my plan...$b$bBut you did hold up your end of the bargain, so here's what I promised.

[npctext 32628]
text0_0=Aye, I'm Durnan Furcutter. You have something for me?

[npctext 32629]
text0_0=Ah good, now this will hit the spot. Allow me to take a small break while I enjoy this scalding mornbrew!

[npctext 32630]
text0_0=I trust the scalding mornbrew got to Durnan on time! Did you remember to bring me back my mug?

[npctext 32631]
text0_0=Excellent, Smishir! You'd be surprised how many couriers I meet who forget to do something as simple as bring back the mug. Mugs don't grow on trees, or so they tell me!$b$bHere's a little something for the effort. Thanks again for your help.

[npctext 32632]
text0_0=May I help you with something?

[npctext 32633]
text0_0=Falla sent you to me? Well now, let's see that shard that you say she was so hesitant to talk about...$b$b<Hamuul peers into the shard>$b$bOh... I didn't... Well.$b$bCob, thank you for delivering this to me. It isn't wise to speak of things such as this, though, I advise you. These are matters that you should not concern yourself with.$b$bLet's just say that things in the Emerald Dream are not as we thought...$b$bPerhaps in the future, our paths may cross again.$b$b

[npctext 32634]
text0_0=Here we are $N, at yet another crossroads. The time has come to make another choice. What choice do you make, mortal?

[npctext 32635]
text0_0=You have made your choice, and so it begins. Your choices have been, to date, what I would consider to be the correct ones; your actions and deeds henceforth will determine whether this is to continue.

[npctext 32636]
text0_0=Sharptusk will trouble us no more once you have brought me proof of his death. It is his head that I seek, $N.$b$bWe tauren live for the hunt, and there is no greater hunt than against one that is cunning enough to perhaps hunt us back. If you are successful in this task, young one, you will start to learn what I mean.

[npctext 32637]
text0_0=Justice has been served on this day by your swift actions, $N. Let this deed serve as a warning to all who would threaten our home.$b$bYou have earned this reward to help you on your sojourn, young $C.

[npctext 32638]
text0_0=Yes, the Sunken Temple, I can say that I have seen it with my own eyes. Perhaps you'd like to hear more about it?$b$bYou look like the adventurous type -- I know things that may intrigue you...

[npctext 32639]
text0_0=I remain here at my master's bidding. I've been given leave to ask any price I wish for transportation up to his tower. For now, I ask for only the two feathers from each traveler so I can continue to make my signature arrows.$b$bIf you're not careful, I'll up the price. How does half a dozen gold sound?$b$bYeah, I thought as much. Just mind yourself and I'll keep the price where it is.

[npctext 32640]
text0_0=Two feathers, just as I asked. And not bad ones at all.$b$bReady then? Just say the word and you're on your way.$b$bOh, and once again, mind yourself... my master doesn't take kindly to imbeciles, but he is very generous to those that please him.

[npctext 32641]
text0_0=The Trade Master still lives?

[npctext 32642]
text0_0=You have struck a decisive blow against the Undermarket. Their leaders will think twice before sending more cronies into the gorge.$b$bOh, and I also found nothing of use in the trader's satchel. You may keep whatever you find inside.

[npctext 32643]
text0_0=Kovic slain??! This is a glorious day, $N! For years that scoundrel has been running shady undermarket trades, undercutting honest, hard working traders all over the world.$b$bYou deserve a fine reward for this accomplishment! And a fine reward you shall have!$b$b

[npctext 32644]
text0_0=Have you heard enough? Are you prepared to act?$b$b

[npctext 32645]
text0_0=Have you collected the materials?

[npctext 32646]
text0_0=Well done, $N. We are almost ready.

[npctext 32647]
text0_0=Eight, $N. I need eight!

[npctext 32648]
text0_0=You're an exceptional laborer, $N. Have you ever considered a change of vocation? Perhaps a detective? Junk collector? Oh, I know, one of those silly gnomes that crawl across the beaches of Azeroth with their metal detecting contraptions, looking for lost treasure. Yes, that would be an ideal position for you.

[npctext 32649]
text0_0=Ratchet is not far from here, $N. The journey shouldn't take long.

[npctext 32650]
text0_0=Yes... This is the stone.$b$bIt's all coming back to me now, $N...

[npctext 32651]
text0_0=Yes, the Sunken Temple, I can say that I have seen it with my own eyes. Perhaps you'd like to hear more about it?$b$bYou look like the adventurous type -- I know things that may intrigue you...

[npctext 32652]
text0_0=Upon examining the statue, you notice a depression in its side, just the size of the token that Marvon gave you...

[npctext 32653]
text0_0=You push the stone circle into the opening, and you hear it lock into place.$b$bNow that the stone is in place, you may continue... but what should you do next?$b$bPerhaps you should examine this altar further...$b$b

[npctext 32654]
text0_0=The eye of the idol glitters brightly even in the half-darkness of the temple. Its transparency reveals something shiny behind it. Sliding it to the side, you reach in and grasp what lies inside the statue.$b$bThe Atal'ai treasure is now yours.

[npctext 32655]
text0_0=Without a suitable source of arcane energy, the torch of retribution cannot be completed.

[npctext 32656]
text0_0=The symbol radiates foul magic; perfectly suited for our task.

[npctext 32657]
text0_0=There is one final task that you must complete.$b$b

[npctext 32658]
text0_0=You grab the torch with both hands; waves of hatred and anger pulse through your being.

[npctext 32659]
text0_0=Are you prepared to make your strike?$b$b

[npctext 32660]
text0_0=It is glorious! Is it not glorious master?

[npctext 32661]
text0_0=The chest opens at your touch. How much cheese could possibly be in here? There is only one way to find out.

[npctext 32662]
text0_0=Have you had any luck in your exploration?

[npctext 32663]
text0_0=You truly disgust me, troll. A grown man drooling over a pile of junk? Pitiful! Take your reward and get out of my sight.

[npctext 32664]
text0_0=Ah, Belgrom wizened up and finally sent someone not in his ranks to aid us, did he?$b$bThis camp used to be a dozen warriors strong, $N, but now they're all dead. That $C, Rimtori, has slain them all. She played Belgrom like a lute... seduced him even. It's none of my business, but between you and I, she is quite the temptress. That's probably why I'm still out here helping Belgrom--I probably would have done the same thing.

[npctext 32665]
text0_0=We've sent everything we had at her and her workers, but they are strong in battle. None have bothered to return. I'm assuming some have died, but I'm sure others simply ran... cowards.$b$bBut now that reinforcements have arrived, perhaps there's still something we can do. Perhaps we can still punish her for lying and betraying Belgrom.$b$bWhat do you say, are you in?

[npctext 32666]
text0_0=The title of the book is emblazoned on the black leather cover in gold leaf--Kaldorei Tome of Summoning. As you open the pages you can see that the book is very old but in superb condition.$b$bYou assume the text is of some ancient language... perhaps Kaldorei?$b$bYour instincts tell you that you should return here once you've finished doling out retribution on the blood elves for their betrayal.

[npctext 32667]
text0_0=You begin to skim some of the pages until you come to a page that's marked by a thin, black strip of silk cloth.$b$bAs you try to decipher the script, you see a diagram on the bottom of one of the pages. A quick look around at the scene before you and you realize that the crystals, the circle, and even some of the other components on the ground are set up in a similar pattern as the diagram.

[npctext 32668]
text0_0=How goes your slaughter of the blood elf traitors, $N? Have you made any progress?$b$bI hope you are the one strong enough to bring that dog to her knees! She deserves nothing but a painful death for all that she has done!

[npctext 32669]
text0_0=RAR!! Incredible!$b$bYou've done it! Belgrom will be pleased! Finally the spirits of dozens of our warriors can be at peace. Thank you, $N.

[npctext 32670]
text0_0=I remember you, $C. I asked you to go to Azshara to destroy that wench that betrayed me! That seems like many moons ago. Don't tell me that Ag'tor and the others are dead also!

[npctext 32671]
text0_0=HAHA! Look at you now, pathetic woman! I spit on your remains!$b$bThank you, $N. Thank you from the bottom of my heart! This is indeed a great day!$b$bI would give you a kingdom if it were in my power! But perhaps you will settle for this.$b$b<Belgrom looks down at the head of the $C who had betrayed him.>$b$bHaha! Stupid blood elf, look at you now... in a burlap sack and missing your body! You should never have betrayed Belgrom!

[npctext 32672]
text0_0=The name of the beast must be found.

[npctext 32673]
text0_0=A demon lord?$b$b<Lord Arkkoroc laughs.>$b$bPerhaps the one can assist you with this information; but first, you must assist the one.$b$b

[npctext 32674]
text0_0=<Lord Arkkoroc bends down to inspect you.>$b$bWhere are they?

[npctext 32675]
text0_0=Finally, one worthy of the wisdom of Arkkoroc!$b$b

[npctext 32676]
text0_0=You return! Astounding, $R. Did you discover the true name?$b$b

[npctext 32677]
text0_0=The temper will add the necessary vitriol we require for the forging of the weapons. There is but one more step in their creation.$b$b

[npctext 32678]
text0_0=Itharius was wise to send you to me. While he is not dead as you understand death, Eranikus will soon give us advice in his own words. For now though, I cannot directly help you... at least not yet.$b$bI will lend my skill at death-speaking to you, but first I need the help of one who - unlike me - is not limited by the frailties of old age. My most potent augury device has been taken from me against my will, and unless I have it back we will be at a loss to help Eranikus.

[npctext 32679]
text0_0=The tablets I'm having you gather should bring in a pretty copper or two to the right parties. I'll tell you who we need to deliver them to after you've found them. But I'm no fool... you'll get your share after I have proof that they've been delivered.$b$bSo get to it--we don't have all day. I might have to find someone else to help me.

[npctext 32680]
text0_0=Perfect, $N, and in good condition also. These should get us a good price from all the parties concerned.$b$bLet's not dawdle around here any longer than we have to. We have some money to make.

[npctext 32681]
text0_0=Yes, $N. What can I do for you? I have many matters I must attend to, so please, be quick.

[npctext 32682]
text0_0=Ah, at long last, the Tablet of Beth'Amara. I was wondering if my partnership with Jediga had failed or if the poor orc had found her death in Azshara. I am glad she was successful.$b$bBeth'Amara was one of the Highborne's most influential alchemists. The wizard alone was said to have mastered transmuting metals among other things.

[npctext 32683]
text0_0=Oh dear; I was wondering why I hadn't seen Iverron yet today. And I've always warned him about those spiders...

[npctext 32684]
text0_0=Have you collected the essence of the screecher spirits, $N?

[npctext 32685]
text0_0=You have done well, $N. Perhaps now it is time to reveal more...$b$bThere is an ancient prophecy among the trolls, where the dead god Hakkar, the Soulflayer, will one day return to this earth. Some say the coming of Hakkar will bring joy and glory to trollkind, while others believe his resurrection marks the end of all things.$b$bI do not believe this myth, but I do know the essence of Hakkar holds great power, and this power should be kept from those who would abuse it...

[npctext 32686]
text0_0=Please, collect the ingredients, $N. Iverron needs our help.

[npctext 32687]
text0_0=Thank Elune that you have gathered these ingredients so quickly!$b$bIn just a moment, I will have the antidote prepared.

[npctext 32688]
text0_0=Oh... $N, I'm so glad you have returned.

[npctext 32689]
text0_0=What is this, $N?$b$bOh, I knew Dirania would be able to help me!$b$b<Iverron drinks the antidote>$b$bI'm always getting into trouble and Dirania, well, she always manages to help me out of it.$b$bI am feeling much better, but I think I will sit here for a while longer, until I feel completely better. Well, that, and I was hoping you'd clear a path for me through those vicious Webwood spiders...

[npctext 32690]
text0_0=I'm not one for politics; I care not if your affiliations are for either Horde or Alliance. I am more interested in squelching direct and dire threats to all the races... and we have quite a large one in here.$b$bIf you're willing to be a true hero for all people, then hand me the oathstone I have given you as a sign of commitment. I'm... not from around these parts; an oathstone is important to people of my kind as a bond of agreement.

[npctext 32691]
text0_0=Fantastic, I thought you looked to be the heroic type! We've got our work cut out for us $N, I'm not going to lie to you. If we stay focused on the task at hand, we should be able to come out on top.$b$bNow, let me bring you up to speed on what's been going on...

[npctext 32692]
text0_0=Do you have the tablets of the Prophecy of Mosh'aru, $N?$b$bWhen I gain the tablets, I will study them, and learn how to contain the essence of Hakkar!

[npctext 32693]
text0_0=Ah, this is good. I can fuse these ancient tablets together, and then study their hidden secrets.$b$bMy debt to you grows, $N. And it will grow further still.

[npctext 32694]
text0_0=Have you defeated the avatar of Hakkar, $N? Has his essence yet empowered the egg I gave you?

[npctext 32695]
text0_0=The essence of Hakkar has been collected! Even now the Egg stirs with life! Could the myths of Hakkar be true?$b$bThat must not be true, for it is then I fear what Hakkar may do if birthed again. I will keep this egg safe and be sure it does not fall into evil hands.$b$bYour labors with me are finished, $N. You have touched a legend, and your actions may one day change the face of our world.

[npctext 32696]
text0_0=Well... ... isn't this a surprise? An adventurererere... !$b$bWhat c'n I do for you... ?

[npctext 32697]
text0_0=Here, take some coin... get yerself... <hic>... some new armor or something....$b$bThis'll bring a shiny gold or two to the right... <hic> people.

[npctext 32698]
text0_0=What can help you with, $N?

[npctext 32699]
text0_0=Ah, the Tablet of Sael'hai... how long I've longed to study it.$b$bThank you, $N. You may tell Jediga that she has done well. This will definitely be worth the payment she asked for.

[npctext 32700]
text0_0=Well, what did Magatha say? The old crone... I bet she was less than polite.

[npctext 32701]
text0_0=Ah, good. She was much more reasonable than I expected... at least towards you. I half expected her to have you punished for my insolence in sending someone in my place. She must really want that tablet. Interesting.$b$bSomething to ponder another time.

[npctext 32702]
text0_0=Have you met with Andron yet? He rarely leaves Undercity, so I don't think it'd be too hard to find him.

[npctext 32703]
text0_0=Perfect... wait a minute.$b$bHaha! What'd you tell him when you delivered the tablet, $N? He overpaid us way too much! Not that I'm complaining. Did you tell him the deal changed? Or was he drunk again?$b$bDoesn't matter... here, take an extra share also.

[npctext 32704]
text0_0=Well, what did Xylem have to say? He didn't do anything to you, did he? Cast a spell on you? Con you into doing work for him?

[npctext 32705]
text0_0=No problems? None at all? Well, that's something to be said... I expected him to show some sort of reluctance or to at least betray our deal. Hmm, maybe he can be trusted after all.$b$bWell, no need to dwell on it that much. Here's your share. Thank you for your help.

[npctext 32706]
text0_0=Those stinkin' Blood elves. I tell ya, if I was as strong as you are, I'd go down there and teach them a thing or two myself! But I'll have to settle with payin' you to take care of 'em for me.

[npctext 32707]
text0_0=Haha! You got them good, didn't you?!$b$bThis is great! That'll teach those Blood elves to betray their partners... especially someone as loyal as a goblin merchant! Bah, Blood elves...!$b$bWell, the least I can do for you is pay you for your time... just like I said I would.$b$bHere you go... those should be useful.

[npctext 32708]
text0_0=Evil does not sleep, fool. You will have time for rest when you are finally dead. Now, bring me those crystals.

[npctext 32709]
text0_0=Your tasks in Azshara are complete, mortal. I must now forge the necessary components for the next step in your adventure.

[npctext 32710]
text0_0=Loramus, eh? It has been many years since I have heard that name.

[npctext 32711]
text0_0=My goodness, I can only imagine what you went through to get these materials. Few venture into Azshara and return alive, let alone those that face demi-gods and giants!$b$b

[npctext 32712]
text0_0=<Galvan wipes the sweat from his brow.>$b$bA finer demon slayer has never existed, $N.

[npctext 32713]
text0_0=You look battle hardened, $N. Are you prepared to face Razelikh and his minions?

[npctext 32714]
text0_0=The three shall form the one, the one shall light the way.

[npctext 32715]
text0_0=The amulet of Razelikh the Defiler is once again complete but he senses the disruption in his chain of command. He knows you come for him...

[npctext 32716]
text0_0=There is nothing left to fear.$b$b

[npctext 32717]
text0_0=Today is a day that will be remembered for all eternity. The demonic overlord of the Blasted Lands has finally fallen!$b$b

[npctext 32718]
text0_0=If you've signed the document and are ready to hand it to me, then that is that. You've been told that this is a one way trip. If you're ready, then hop on board!

[npctext 32719]
text0_0=Welcome aboard, Goblin Engineer $N! You soon will have access to the most powerful engineering schemata anywhere on Azeroth.$b$bNow that you have committed yourself to the pursuit of this knowledge, it is time to examine your goblin-oriented engineering work. From there, we'll help you build a plan to maximize your goblin engineering talents!

[npctext 32720]
text0_0=Once I receive your crafted engineering items for my review, I will hand you a genuine Goblin Engineer Membership Card! So long as the card is valid, you will have unlimited access to any goblin engineer trainer anywhere in the world.

[npctext 32721]
text0_0=Here is your first Goblin Engineer Membership Card!$b$bThis card has its dues paid for in advance for fourteen days; all cards expire after two weeks of activity. When it does, pay your next set of dues to any goblin engineer trainer in order to get another card; without the card, your membership will temporarily lapse and you cannot access new schemata.$b$bThis never affects what you already know; once a goblin engineer, always a goblin engineer.

[npctext 32722]
text0_0=Try to avoid them if you can, $N. The Wildkin may misread your interest as an intent to do them harm...

[npctext 32723]
text0_0=Thank you for bringing these to me, $N.$b$bWhat did you learn of the Wildkin?$b$bPerhaps these feathers will tell us more. Ferocious monsters, or simply misguided pets? One day I'd like to know the truth...$b$bI am going to continue my research -- please come back and talk to me again after some time has passed.

[npctext 32724]
text0_0=Do you bring new information?

[npctext 32725]
text0_0=Shall we proceed?

[npctext 32726]
text0_0=Hi. I miss my necklace. My daddy got it for me. Daddy says that there are monsters in the lake. Did you beat up any monsters?

[npctext 32727]
text0_0=Thank you for finding my necklace mister $C... you are very kind! My kitty thanks you too - isn't that right Effsee?

[npctext 32728]
text0_0=Ah, so my brother, Argos, sent you? I realize you must be weary from your travels. But we have much to talk about.

[npctext 32729]
text0_0=I've got lots to get started on here. Please get me those furs as soon as you can!

[npctext 32730]
text0_0=These furs are perfect, $N. We're off to a great start here!

[npctext 32731]
text0_0=Yes $N, have you grown some morrowgrain for the Arch $C's important research? The mysterious properties of Un'Goro Crater become clearer with each passing day, thanks to the help you are giving us.

[npctext 32732]
text0_0=Well done $N, I will be sure to give these to the Arch $C himself when he has need of them. Meanwhile, please accept this as a token of the Cenarion Circle's appreciation.$b$bOur need for morrowgrain, for now, is constant; if you wish to continue aiding us, then please return when you have cultivated more of it.

[npctext 32733]
text0_0=Whether it is greed which brought you here or an act of selfless devotion, what you are about to undertake is for the good of us all.

[npctext 32734]
text0_0=The statue looms ominously above you.

[npctext 32735]
text0_0=The hammer slides firmly into place, within the grasp of the massive Dark Iron monument. A tiny compartment opens at the base of the statue. Inside you find...

[npctext 32736]
text0_0=My poor Thal'trak.$b$bWe were planning on moving in with my mother and father in the Hinterlands after our tours were over. Now those plans are ruined!

[npctext 32737]
text0_0=Did you find Sha'ni? Is she ok?

[npctext 32738]
text0_0=<Thal'trak collapses.>$b$bWe were going to move to the Hinterlands. Did she tell you? This was going to be her last mission.$b$b<Thal'trak sobs.>$b$bI don't want it, $N. Keep it, throw it away, I don't care! The ring means nothing to me now. Not without her...

[npctext 32739]
text0_0=A water-logged pack rests at the bottom of the pond.

[npctext 32740]
text0_0=Hi there. I've seen you before... Haven't I?

[npctext 32741]
text0_0=Oh... Yes, these things do look familiar... well, kind of...

[npctext 32742]
text0_0=If we're going to have any chance of getting out of here alive, we'll need our big crate of foodstuffs. Also, getting at least some of our research equipment back would be a blessing in a sea of misery.

[npctext 32743]
text0_0=You got both our foodstuff AND our research equipment back! You've not only saved the expedition, you've also saved our lives. I and the rest of my team can't thank you enough; we just might make it here for a while now thanks to you.$b$bWhile we don't have much, I'm certainly not going to leave you high and dry for the invaluable help you've given us. Thank you, $N - you've got a friend in Marshal Expeditions!$b$b

[npctext 32744]
text0_0=Think whatever you want of me, but they're not going to care if the bones they get to research are from ones from ancient stegodons and dimetrodons or the ones that almost devoured us wholesale when we were trying to set up our camps. I'll just be happy if we get out of here alive...

[npctext 32745]
text0_0=Excellent, these should do the trick. And now, if you'll permit me...$b$bTHANKS FOR DIGGING ALL OF THESE BONES OUT OF THE GROUND FOR US AND NOT HURTING THE NATIVE BEASTS IN ANY WAY.$b$bWhether you really did or didn't, I don't want to know. Let's keep it that way, shall we? Here - maybe this will keep your lips shut on the whole thing. Anything to get out of here alive, I say!

[npctext 32746]
text0_0=Do you have the sample of the Gorishi hive for me to study, $N?

[npctext 32747]
text0_0=Yes, this will do nicely. You've been a great help... I wish I could give you more than this, but being virtually stranded in the middle of a savage land does limit what I can and cannot give. Rest assured though - the research done here would not have been possible without your assistance!

[npctext 32748]
text0_0=Hello there! I and my companions are happy to see some living beings here other than overgrown savage beasts! What brings you into the Un'Goro Crater?

[npctext 32749]
text0_0=Well look at this - my journal! I thought it was lost, much like almost everything else we brought into Un'Goro. I thank you kindly for returning this to me!

[npctext 32750]
text0_0=Those who dally in this task might as well end up wandering about aimlessly like our fallen brothers and sisters in the village. Let's hope you will fare better than them, yes? $b$b

[npctext 32751]
text0_0=I am finished with you, $N - you have shown yourself to be worthy of the freedom that you have been given. Many will stand against you for what you have become, but know that no matter what they may try to do against us, we are free and will not be shackled again.$b$bTake these and be on your way. You have much to accomplish, $C.

[npctext 32752]
text0_0=Have you managed to scavenge up some useful items for us? There is no shame in reusing that which has been tossed aside. No one is going to give us any handouts - we Forsaken will fend for ourselves!

[npctext 32753]
text0_0=Great work $N, I knew you weren't useless. Here - have one of the better items I've found out of the lots that have been collected so far.

[npctext 32754]
text0_0=Oh, Deputy Willem told you to speak with me? He's a brave man and always willing to help, but his duties keep him stuck at Northshire Abbey and I'm afraid the problem I have today is beyond him.$b$bPerhaps you can help me?

[npctext 32755]
text0_0=Do you have my harvest, $N?

[npctext 32756]
text0_0=Oh thank you, $N! You saved my harvest! And I hope you showed a few of those Defias that they can't cause trouble around here.$b$bWe might be short on guards these days, but we're lucky to have heroes like you to protect us!

[npctext 32757]
text0_0=You look to be in fine spirits! Come! Have a seat, and have a drink!

[npctext 32758]
text0_0=Let's see here...$b$bOh my! Milly's grapes have been saved! When she told me that brigands overran her vineyards I nearly despaired, but my faith in the Light did not waver!$b$bAnd through your bravery, we now have grapes for more wine! May the Light bless you, $N, and keep you safe!

[npctext 32759]
text0_0=This cannot be... it must not be. The destruction of Pyron has merely lifted a veil. Within the depths of Blackrock is a much more insidious source of corruption.$b$b

[npctext 32760]
text0_0=The flames will soon overtake these lands. Make haste, $N!$b$b

[npctext 32761]
text0_0=<Thunderheart clutches the Tablet of Kurniya.>$b$bRagnaros... here...$b$bThe elders were right to fear the corruption emanating from Blackrock Mountain. A general of the Old Gods! IN OUR WORLD! We must reassess our position here in Kargath. We must decide on whether we stay and fight or run for fear of a new sundering.$b$bBe weary of any further exploration in Blackrock Mountain, $N. A far greater evil than anything that exists in this world resides in those fiery depths.$b$b

[npctext 32762]
text0_0=My, my... So Linken did finally get around to sending me his sword.

[npctext 32763]
text0_0=Well, of course I can temper this sword. While I'm working, you can explain what took Linken so long to get this to me. He's not usually one to forget things...

[npctext 32764]
text0_0=Back already?

[npctext 32765]
text0_0=I'll need one vial to make sure that this is truly the elixir... Yes... This is the stuff.

[npctext 32766]
text0_0=$b$bShow them to me!

[npctext 32767]
text0_0=Wonderful! I will have these sent by courier to the Undercity at once!$b$bAs for you - here is payment, as promised. Keep the change, you filthy beast!$b$b

[npctext 32768]
text0_0=It has been long since any have come to talk with me...

[npctext 32769]
text0_0=This must be the gravestone that Gaeriyan mentioned...

[npctext 32770]
text0_0=You push on the stone firmly, and it slides away, revealing a small depression underneath it.$b$bPlacing Linken's Sword into the depression, you realize that it fits perfectly...

[npctext 32771]
text0_0=Oh! I remember you! You are... No, don't tell me!

[npctext 32772]
text0_0=My sword... It's finished!$b$bNow, if only I could remember why I needed this...$b$bHere, let me at least pay you for your work.

[npctext 32773]
text0_0=Stay where you are for just a moment... I am testing out a new combination of crystals...

[npctext 32774]
text0_0=Hello, $C. Is there something I can help you with?

[npctext 32775]
text0_0=Hi, again, $N!

[npctext 32776]
text0_0=Did J.D. help you at all?

[npctext 32777]
text0_0=Blazerunner is almost invincible behind the aura he has created by using the Golden Flame. Only you have the power to remove it with the Silver Totem of Aquementas.

[npctext 32778]
text0_0=Thank you, $N.$b$bThe Golden Flame will now be returned back to my homeland, where it may be protected, never again to be used for evil.$b$bSince you did so much for me, I'd like you to have this. Without you, I'd still have no idea who I am!

[npctext 32779]
text0_0=So you're back, eh? Hmm... Let me take a look at that, $N.

[npctext 32780]
text0_0=Blazerunner, you say...$b$bYes, I am aware that a strong elemental resides in the charred center of the crater. We all just keep our distance; none have been able to penetrate the powerful aura that surrounds him. Many have been pushed from the rocky paths onto the ground below when trying to face him.

[npctext 32781]
text0_0=<Cyrus examines the molt.>$b$bYou have proven that you are not entirely useless, mortal.$b$b

[npctext 32782]
text0_0=<Cyrus examines the molt.>$b$bYou have proven that you are not entirely useless, mortal.

[npctext 32783]
text0_0=Has the giant been felled?

[npctext 32784]
text0_0=<Cyrus snatches the fiery essence from your hands.>$b$bYES!$b$bTake your prize and be gone. Leave my sight at once!

[npctext 32785]
text0_0=Do not take this task lightly, $N!

[npctext 32786]
text0_0=<Theodora lays the fragments out before her.>$b$b<Theodora carefully examines the fragments with an enormous monocle.>$b$bInteresting. Etched into the structural foundation of each of these fragments are... initials.$b$b

[npctext 32787]
text0_0=What have you got there, $R?

[npctext 32788]
text0_0=<Lotwil's face turns white.>$b$bI... I know these markings.

[npctext 32789]
text0_0=Was it him? Was he really alive?

[npctext 32790]
text0_0=What is this?!? This head is not flesh. This is some sort of dark iron creation: A shadow of Argelmach - ANOTHER machine! I suspect that your destruction of Argelmach will be short lived as another shall rise to take 'its' place soon.

[npctext 32791]
text0_0=I can tell you more of the power of which you required to defeat Blazerunner, but first, you need to gather the things I require.

[npctext 32792]
text0_0=Very well, $N. I can see you are serious about helping your friend.

[npctext 32793]
text0_0=Everything touched by the fel emanates a strange green glow... I sense it is evil, but at the same time, very powerful.

[npctext 32794]
text0_0=It sounds from your descriptions as if the creatures show a mindless ferocity...$b$bStay alert, $N. It would be in your best interest to learn more of the corruption. Always know your enemy.

[npctext 32795]
text0_0=Do you have the Heart of the Mountain? To me, its value is without limit.

[npctext 32796]
text0_0=You have the heart! Amazing! It is even more beautiful than I imagined!$b$bPlease, $N, take this as payment!

[npctext 32797]
text0_0=Do you have the recipe, $N? I can't stand the idea of those Dark Iron dwarves drinking my family's drink!

[npctext 32798]
text0_0=You found it! Well done! And I hope you gave those Dark Irons, and Hurley Blackbreath, a good thumping!$b$bThe Thunderbrews are at your service, $N. You are a hero of heroes!

[npctext 32799]
text0_0=Thank you for coming, $N. This place is not without a stark charm, but is lacks the amenities of the Apothecarium.$b$bEnough with the pleasantries. To business, yes?

[npctext 32800]
text0_0=Do you have the recipe for the Thunderbrew Lager, $N?

[npctext 32801]
text0_0=Very good. I will send this recipe to the Apothecarium to be studied, and in time we will unlock its secrets. One day, the dwarves of the Alliance may find the virtues of this drink used against them!$b$bI find that terribly amusing. Perhaps death has an affect on one's sense of humor... do you think?

[npctext 32802]
text0_0=Do you have Ribbly? Or, at least a part of him?

[npctext 32803]
text0_0=Aha! You found him! And... it appears that my little brother didn't want to come quiety. It's a pity. I would have liked to see the look on his face when I told him our plans to turn him in to Revilgaz.$b$bThank you, $N. You've made my family very happy. And Ribbly's never looked as peaceful as he does now.

[npctext 32804]
text0_0=Thanks for your help, $N, but I'm afraid I have some bad news...

[npctext 32805]
text0_0=This is exhausting, $N. Those things just won't leave me alone!

[npctext 32806]
text0_0=So, Marvon wasn't around? Well, show me what you got, anyway.

[npctext 32807]
text0_0=Marvon's been gone quite a long time now, $N. He went off to Tanaris to study some of the ancient troll ruins.$b$bNow, what was it that you said you needed?

[npctext 32808]
text0_0=Remember the balance, $N. I wish you to develop an understanding and a strong empathy for the living forests.

[npctext 32809]
text0_0=Always remember what I have shown you today, $N. You are part of the balance that the night elves strive to keep intact, even during troublesome times.

[npctext 32810]
text0_0=As you look A-Me 01 over, you see two huge dents tarnishing what Karna obviously feels is a well-crafted piece of engineering. One dent decorates A-Me 01's shoulder, the other is on her head.$b$bNo power seems to be running through her components as you investigate further.

[npctext 32811]
text0_0=The panel in which the mithril casing goes is still closed shut. The rest of A-Me 01 remains inert.

[npctext 32812]
text0_0=You remove the panel from A-Me 01's back yet again and carefully remove the old mithril casing that seems to have burnt out. The new one slides into place easily. The only thing left to do, assuming the mithril casing was the problem, is to flip the switch to the "Off" position, and then back to the "On" position.

[npctext 32813]
text0_0=Oh, you've done it! Wonderful! Thank you, $N.$b$bOh, my poor, A-Me. Look at all those dents. We'll get her up and running perfectly with just a little work.$b$bThank you again, $N. I really appreciate it.

[npctext 32814]
text0_0=Oh dear! Are you sure Incendius said 'Ragnaros?'$b$b<Jalinda hands you something and pats you on the wrist as she fades deep into thought.>

[npctext 32815]
text0_0=Welcome to Thalanaar, $C. Do you need assistance of some sort?

[npctext 32816]
text0_0=Elune be praised, the delivery from Feathermoon Stronghold has finally arrived!$b$bYour presence here indicates to me that perhaps some ill fate may have befallen Raschal, our usual courier. I hope that everything works out. I know that recently, the Woodpaw have become highly agitated from some source to their south. Maybe he fell to the wilds there; I would be careful, friend.$b$bRegardless, thank you again. Here is payment for this parcel's delivery.

[npctext 32817]
text0_0=I just know I'm onto something here, $N!

[npctext 32818]
text0_0=Now I will continue my experiments! Thank you, $N.

[npctext 32819]
text0_0=I know the stories are true, $N.

[npctext 32820]
text0_0=Un'Goro is such a strange place, $N. When you enter the crater, it's as if you are in a completely different world...

[npctext 32821]
text0_0=There are many hidden areas of the crater along the sides. Try exploring the winding paths if you can't think of anywhere else to look, $N.

[npctext 32822]
text0_0=Have the creatures here bested you already, $N?$b$bDo not be dissuaded so easily. Tracking and defeating the apes of Un'Goro is no simple task, even for a great $C.

[npctext 32823]
text0_0=So, you have proven strong, strong enough to best the great apes of Un'Goro--that is good. The challenge was small compared to Lar'korwi, but I will not take such a great victory away from you.$b$bThese pelts will make wonderful clothing for my tribe. You have helped me and proven worthy.$b$bBefore you set off on another task, let us give praise to the Earth Mother and thank the spirits of those apes you killed--they must know their deaths will not be wasted.

[npctext 32824]
text0_0=Do not take my words lightly, $N. If you truly wish to face this creature, then you must be careful... and smart. It will take a great deal of strength and insight to draw out Lar'korwi and defeat him.

[npctext 32825]
text0_0=This will do nicely, $N. It seems Lar'korwi eats well these days. Although, I wonder where he found a threshadon in this area. Odd.$b$bRegardless, I will hold onto this until you are ready for your confrontation with the beast. Do not worry for my safety--I am sure you've angered Lar'korwi enough that he will not kill me until after he's tasted your flesh.

[npctext 32826]
text0_0=Be careful, $N. Getting close to any of nest of eggs surely will provoke the mothers... even if you've already secured a gland from one. The mothers can be just as deadly as Lar'korwi himself when they fight to protect their young. But, if you are successful, then we shall have a definitive way of bringing Lar'korwi out from hiding.

[npctext 32827]
text0_0=Ah, fine specimens, $N. The two pieces you've found should be perfect for baiting Lar'korwi into the open. I cannot wait to see the outcome of your fight with the monster. He is a massive thing with claws as sharp as the finest blades. You will look into his eyes and you will know death.

[npctext 32828]
text0_0=Do not let fear overpower you, $N. Fear is the great betrayer... you must remain strong!$b$bTake the meat, place it in the small valley, and then use the gland on it. Only then will death come for you.

[npctext 32829]
text0_0=The Earth Mother be praised! You've done it! Fair play to you, $N. You have proven to be a great $C in your own right. Your spirit is strong. Your bravery unmatched. And your strength has been fortified. I bow down to your skills.$b$bOnly the greatest of my ancestors could have accomplished something so incredible. Congratulations.

[npctext 32830]
text0_0=Do you have the writings of the Seven, $N? Have you learned the secrets from their tablet?

[npctext 32831]
text0_0=Ah, you found the tablet! And your transcription is superb! Are you sure you're a $C and not a scribe?$b$bHere you are, $N. Here is the payment I promised.

[npctext 32832]
text0_0=Me clients are not so patient, $N. Have you gotten any of the claws yet?

[npctext 32833]
text0_0=Ah, these do nicely. Thank you, $N. An' you be here long before they needed... that be good.$b$bMaybe we have a weapon fashioned for you from the claws. What do you say?

[npctext 32834]
text0_0=U'cha... the beast was magnificent. Huge and red, with teeth the size of daggers. His arms as thick as tree trunks, and as fast as any mountain lion I have ever laid eyes upon. You should consider yourself lucky to find such a test of bravery--my people would go generations without seeing such a creature.

[npctext 32835]
text0_0=Well done, $N. I am pleased. You have done a great thing here today.$b$bU'cha was one of the greatest apes I had ever seen. The fact that you have bested his strength speaks well of your own strength... and courage.$b$bIt is only fitting that I give you this as a sign of respect. You have earned it.

[npctext 32836]
text0_0=Alright, $N. This is fascinating... I can only hope that my diagrams are correct! I compiled everything into this manual, which you can have.$b$bI believe I can answer any questions you have about the crystals now, $N.

[npctext 32837]
text0_0=Have you finished collecting cactus apples?

[npctext 32838]
text0_0=Wonderful, $N! As promised, here is your cactus apple surprise plus a little something extra.

[npctext 32839]
text0_0=I ain't got all day! Get me those pieces of silk cloth! I mean geologists. Get those geologists! They deserve to feel my, well... your wrath.

[npctext 32840]
text0_0=Oh, this is great! Nice feel to it too!$b$bWhat? Oh, yeah... geologists. Got 'em good, did ya? I can't thank ya enough, $N. That'll give me some time to finish up in here... I mean, it'll let me not have to worry about them comin' back for me anytime soon. Thanks again.

[npctext 32841]
text0_0=*cough*$b$bWho is it? Can't ya see I'm busy?

[npctext 32842]
text0_0=Well, I'll be! How in tarnation!? You found the key! I knew them blasted Dark Irons were hiding it after they locked me in here! Thank ya so much, $N. You're the greatest! Now, just turn the key and let ol' Locheed outta here!

[npctext 32843]
text0_0=Ringo's not in the best shape, $N, but I am glad to have him back in one piece!$b$bThank you for finding him.

[npctext 32844]
text0_0=Wha... What?

[npctext 32845]
text0_0=Oh... I'm so glad someone found me...

[npctext 32846]
text0_0=Yes, I gathered that Zilzibin sent you to me. Your experience in fighting these beasties is priceless; no one to my knowledge has ever dealt with their kind before. As for Zil's idea that Un'Goro Crater is their heart... perhaps it is. Un'Goro is a mysterious and dangerous jungle to the west of here. Perhaps it is also one step closer to figuring out what the silithid are all about.

[npctext 32847]
text0_0=I'm so glad you found me, Ve. How did you know I was here?

[npctext 32848]
text0_0=Finding a suitable scent gland might take a bit - the gland can't be damaged, but the process of getting one certainly doesn't lend itself to it. As for the soil, I'd assume it should be easy enough to find.$b$bAnyway, do you have the items I need to make the lure?

[npctext 32849]
text0_0=The scent gland, ah yes. The membrane appears intact - excellent. The soil, yes, this should work out perfectly. With my special additions, I should be able to grind all this up into the perfect lure.$b$bGive me a moment to make the lure, $N. Once it's ready, we'll be able to enact the next step that may hopefully stop the silithid before they overrun Gadgetzan... and the rest of Kalimdor.

[npctext 32850]
text0_0=I am absolutely terrified of the pterrordax here! Thank you for decreasing their numbers, $N. Now I might feel safe enough to venture out of Marshal's Refuge.

[npctext 32851]
text0_0=Is it true that the volcano in Un'Goro is active? I'm sure I could learn a lot with some ash from the volcano, $N.

[npctext 32852]
text0_0=These samples will be perfect for my studies! Thank you, $N! I promise, you'll be the first one I will tell about my findings.

[npctext 32853]
text0_0=Every great vehicle needs a name... I was thinking I'd call it... Pwned!

[npctext 32854]
text0_0=Yes, these scales are perfect. I should be able to get this flyer off the ground with these scales for sure!$b$bThanks!

[npctext 32855]
text0_0=Tran'rek's done it again -- this super sticky glue will be all the rage!

[npctext 32856]
text0_0=Yes, this tar is just the stuff...$b$bHey, wait a minute, my hands... I can't seem to get them apart...$b$bMaybe this wasn't such a good idea. Oh, but wait! Super sticky tar remover! That's where the real money is!

[npctext 32857]
text0_0=This is of utmost importance. Be on your way, now.

[npctext 32858]
text0_0=Very well. We must find a way to use this corruption against our enemies...

[npctext 32859]
text0_0=Don't tell me that you can't go back there! Get going!

[npctext 32860]
text0_0=Excellent!$b$bThe forsaken will resort to any means necessary to crush the alliance! The use of the corrupted water will surely prove useful in our future efforts...

[npctext 32861]
text0_0=Report back to me after you have completed the task I gave you.

[npctext 32862]
text0_0=This is excellent news, $N. With these beasts out of the way, we can begin to adventure further into Winterspring. Are you ready for more?

[npctext 32863]
text0_0=What do you want, $C? An urgent message - for me?$b

[npctext 32864]
text0_0=More bad news! These centaurs have gone too far! They raided one of my supply caravans and slaughtered the whole party. This is an outrage, and it will not go unpunished!$b

[npctext 32865]
text0_0=It would seem that the device needs some sort of grime-encrusted object to clean and three silver coins to get the contraption working. So long as both are present, the Sparklematic 5200 should work...

[npctext 32866]
text0_0=You insert the grime-encrusted item and three silver coins into the Sparklematic 5200. The machine surges to live in an almost frenzied attempt to purge the grime from the unknown item. Loud, violent churning sounds beat from the heart of the machine. The metal frame of the beast creaks and groans as it lurches from side to side...

[npctext 32867]
text0_0=Another one of Kaltunk's recruits, hm?$b$bA sorry state of affairs we find ourselves in if this is the best the Horde can produce. No matter. By the time we think you're ready to leave the Valley, you'll be a proud $C of the Horde.

[npctext 32868]
text0_0=Hard work is something I have great respect for, $N. Now we can move forward with our plans for Winterspring.

[npctext 32869]
text0_0=Hello again, $N! Are you here to report on another discovery?

[npctext 32870]
text0_0=The bones you have are from gentle sea mammals that are known to inhabit the waters surrounding the base of Teldrassil. They had never been known to violently beach themselves like the threshers had been known to. Why would these creatures do this, I wonder? Well, perhaps the study of their remains will bear the fruits of knowledge that we seek.$b$bAgain, thank you for your aid. Please accept this honorarium from the Temple of the Moon.

[npctext 32871]
text0_0=With the pack mistress slain, we can begin to thin out the worg sentries of the Spire and eventually make some headway into the city.

[npctext 32872]
text0_0=It is a pleasure to see you again, $N. We are making great strives in uncovering the mystery of why majestic sea creatures beach themselves on the Darkshore coastline, but with every question answered, two more are raised it seems.$b$bAre you here to offer us more aid in our research?

[npctext 32873]
text0_0=I have heard of the kinds of carriages found on the back of the turtle you found. Those I do believe are naga carriages, used both in battle and in transportation of their supplies on to land. The markings on the box you found are of the naga; this would explain their invasive presence in far-northern Darkshore.$b$bI will send this box to Darnassus along with the rest of your discoveries. This is for you - thank you again for your assistance.

[npctext 32874]
text0_0=Do you have the broodling essence, $N? I can't wait to study it.$b$bAnd besides that... my patron is not the type of person you want to disappoint.

[npctext 32875]
text0_0=It worked! You got the essence! Well done, $N! Well done!$b$bThis essence will be invaluable in my research. I hope to one day learn how to capture living dragons whelps, or perhaps capture their eggs. If I could find a way to do that, then I would be the envy of dragon scholars around the world!$b$bMy employer would also be happy, and as I said before, he's someone you want to keep happy...

[npctext 32876]
text0_0=$b$b

[npctext 32877]
text0_0=You got 'em at the perfect time, $N. Any later and they'd be untrainable! Gimmie a minute and I'll have the little fella ready for you to take home.

[npctext 32878]
text0_0=$N, did you test the eggscilloscope?

[npctext 32879]
text0_0=It worked? Splendid! I knew it would!$b$bWhile you were gone I was working on a new version of the eggscilloscope. This one has a much longer range.$b$bHere, you can have one in case you go back to Blackrock Spire.

[npctext 32880]
text0_0=Well, looks like you're here to more than just inquire! The citizens will be delighted to know that tonight they will sleep a little bit more soundly and safer.$b$bYou've acted as the executioner of justice for the people of Auberdine today, $N. For that, I would like to offer you this as a suitable reward... for a true hero of the Auberdine people.

[npctext 32881]
text0_0=I sense that you are enjoying your work. And I believe that we are onto something here.

[npctext 32882]
text0_0=Well met, $C. Your scouting of the furbolg situation comes at a fortuitous time for us in Auberdine. For some time we have dealt with not only forest dwellers who are now openly hostile to our presence, but also the outright corruption of the forest itself. Hopefully you might be able to lend Auberdine aid during these troubling times.

[npctext 32883]
text0_0=The pollution of the Cliffspring River is but the start of an alarming trend here in Darkshore. The sample you provide will help us formalize a plan... a plan of attack, I am starting to suspect.

[npctext 32884]
text0_0=It's no surprise how tainted this water is, but just look at how putrid it is becoming! It would seem that action is needed sooner than later, eh $N?$b$bTo our east is Felwood; it is the real source of this corruption, one that I have seen in times past. I predict this sample will confirm this. We might be able to enact a cure for it here, but in order to even try we will need assistance. When that time comes $N, I hope you will be able to give the aid we need.

[npctext 32885]
text0_0=The Talisman of Corruption is a sinister device that only serves to pervert the balance of nature. When you obtain this item from whatever satyr is tormenting the furbolgs and bring it to me for disposal, we will have won a great victory this day!

[npctext 32886]
text0_0=We have just begun this war to reclaim our forest from the forces of corruption, but a battle this day has been won! $N, the people of Auberdine owe you a debt of gratitude that will never be easily repaid. Please accept this along with our thanks. What we have learned here today may one day free our furbolg friends from the shackles of torment permanently.

[npctext 32887]
text0_0=$N, have you retrieved the wyvern eggs that I seek? I'm really anxious to start my wind rider training!

[npctext 32888]
text0_0=Perfect! With these eggs I hope to take the next step to become a wind rider. Here is a token of my appreciation; may good hunting always shine upon you, $C.

[npctext 32889]
text0_0=Have you found the Tablet, Morior? I yearn to delve into its secrets.

[npctext 32890]
text0_0=Excellent. The formulae etched into this tablet will consume days of research, but I am confident such research will bear sweet fruit.$b$bThank you, $N. You have been invaluable to us.

[npctext 32891]
text0_0=Whats! If I knew that Pao'ka Swiftmountain was going to snoop around Highperch, I would have chained him to a totem! His father was reluctant allowing him to come with me to Thousand Needles. We came here to study the different creatures that inhabit these beautiful lands.$b$bI appreciate the help you have shown Pao'ka. I hope this covers any misfortunes this deed has cost you.

[npctext 32892]
text0_0=Do you have the ancient egg? I sense great forces stirring, and I fear that time grows short.

[npctext 32893]
text0_0=Ah, you have the egg! I bow to you, $N. Your strength and bravery will be long remembered.

[npctext 32894]
text0_0=Have you been to the spire, $N? Do you have the fifth and sixth tables?

[npctext 32895]
text0_0=It's cold up here! I hope you brought me a blanket!

[npctext 32896]
text0_0=That's no blanket! But what have we here? I letter from Tinkee? I wonder what she has to say...$b$bAh, she's studying in the Burning Steppes. That makes sense--that's a good source for dragonkin. Oh, but look! It says here that she needs some parts for a device she wants to build. I guess that's where I come in, eh?

[npctext 32897]
text0_0=Do you have the chillwind horns, $N?

[npctext 32898]
text0_0=These are good specimens. They're packed with cold! Let me get some gloves on, then pack them along with the other things Tinkee needs...

[npctext 32899]
text0_0=$N! Did you talk to Felnok? Did you bring the components I need?

[npctext 32900]
text0_0=You brought them! Great! I'll get to work right away! Thanks a ton, $N!$b$bYou've been so helpful to me, I might need you for even more important tasks later...

[npctext 32901]
text0_0=So the crystal exists, $N? Fascinating... anyway, your task has been well executed; good work!$b$bWhat exactly is this crystal? This is but a single question in a sea of questions. Another question that comes to mind is why the moonkin would be drawn to this object? Is the crystal benign in nature, or does it hold a more sinister purpose?$b$bI have many more questions, but we're going to need to examine that crystal closely to get some answers.

[npctext 32902]
text0_0=The crystal looks very alien against the wooded scenery of Darkshore. You think you hear a very slight humming coming from deep within it.

[npctext 32903]
text0_0=You have made it once more to the mysterious crystal. Removing the stopper on the tube of moonwell water, you gingerly pour the contents out over the top of the crystal. As the water cascades down its lattices, you see the opaque surface turn transparent...

[npctext 32904]
text0_0=Well, it would seem that even though we know more about this crystal, more unanswered questions are the result!$b$bI'll take the information you've uncovered to the council here in Auberdine. Perhaps they'll know a course of action to follow on this crystal. Well, that is if there is one to be taken; for now, the threat remains far enough to our east to be out of harm's way.$b$bAs for you, please have this. Consider it a reward for a job well done, $N.

[npctext 32905]
text0_0=I must know more about this mysterious egg, who knows what will hatch from it.

[npctext 32906]
text0_0=Yes, finally... the mysterious egg has finally been delivered to me. Now, let me take a closer look at this... What..! What is this..?$b

[npctext 32907]
text0_0=Yes, the demons there in Darkwhisper Gorge; I believe it is their presence that is affecting the land in this way. I am going to continue observing the hot springs here and see if I learn anything more.$b$bI'd wait until you are a bit stronger if you have plans of heading farther into Darkwhisper Gorge.

[npctext 32908]
text0_0=Vengeance! So, the legend of Arikara is true. Indeed, this is a problem that must be resolved immediately.

[npctext 32909]
text0_0=Ah! Do you have my mojo?

[npctext 32910]
text0_0=Aha! I can already feel my powers returning to me. And my mind is no longer wracked by Urok's curse.$b$bThank you, $N! Humility is below me, but I must acknowledge your aid.$b$bAnd I bid you fortune in your journeys through Blackrock Spire. You are a fool to think you could make your way to the top, but your bravery is without question.

[npctext 32911]
text0_0=They come to kill me? I will show them how a Tauren fights!

[npctext 32912]
text0_0=Reporting for another assignment?

[npctext 32913]
text0_0=An important discovery?

[npctext 32914]
text0_0=How may I help you, $N?

[npctext 32915]
text0_0=The energy of this necklace, $N. I believe that it has only one source.$b$b<Nara closes her eyes and is quiet for a moment.>$b$bThe wildkin, now misguided and confused, were once not so. They once had a purpose, and were guided to serve. The night elf goddess Elune created these creatures to guard her most sacred areas.$b$bWhile this fact may seem like it holds little value; I urge you to look deeper.$b$bYou will learn, in time. Thank you for bringing this to me, $N.

[npctext 32916]
text0_0=Thalia Amberhide:

[npctext 32917]
text0_0=Thank you, $N. Deep in my bones I knew that she would find her way back to me. She told me of your bravery and how you helped her escape. These items belonged to her brother. I know she would want you to have them.

[npctext 32918]
text0_0=Felnok was right! I do need your help again, and this time... it's going to be really dangerous.$b$bAre you ready??

[npctext 32919]
text0_0=<Thrall appears dismayed by the news you bring.>

[npctext 32920]
text0_0=Thank you for your help, $N. I couldn't have held them off without you.

[npctext 32921]
text0_0=Discipline and determination are your goals. I may ask you to do a simple task many times; you must perform to the best of your ability each time.

[npctext 32922]
text0_0=Thank you for assisting me, Ama. My opinion of you grows as time passes.

[npctext 32923]
text0_0=Temporal parasites are a common malady present wherever the flow of time has been tampered with. I sense that many are present, and this is disturbing.$b$bRooting out whatever ones you can find will help me be able to take a better hold on the deteriorating temporal situation here. I will be able to sense when this has been achieved.

[npctext 32924]
text0_0=Time feels easier to mend now, thank you $N. While you might not understand fully the consequences of a fractured timeline, I appreciate that you understand the urgency of countering what I suspect more and more to be a Scourge-driven malfeasance.$b$bI see no harm in rewarding you for your assistance, mortal. Your greatest feats are to come, and the awarding of a bauble will certainly not alter your future destiny. Your continued aid, however, is something that I and the dragonflight could use...

[npctext 32925]
text0_0=The time trinkets I seek are simple devices. They are watches mainly, and their hands are trapped forever when the plague first ravaged Andorhal.$b$bTime is never ending, and the watches you bring to me will invariably find themselves counted out back to their homes... that is, so long as the disturbances continue here.

[npctext 32926]
text0_0=These are exactly what I need, $N. Thank you.$b$bAllow me to suitably reward you with this. You may not understand what you would need with such a device. You might not even know quite what it really is. Alas, I cannot tell you when you will find it most useful; just know that at some point in the future, you may find this item to have extreme utility and function when consumed. Whether or not you choose to hold on to it until then... this, my friend, is up to you.

[npctext 32927]
text0_0=I won't lie to you, $R. I needed the money! Kibler pays very, very well - much better than the K.E.F. ever could.$b$bBut don't doubt my loyalties! Why do you think I'm down here? To get that crazy goblin some exotic animal eggs or something equally inane? No, only someone truly daft would come to Blackrock Spire to collect pets. Yep, I don't reckon too many people like that exist in this world.$b$b<Bijou laughs.>$b$bThe last thing we need are those kinds of people breeding.

[npctext 32928]
text0_0=Where's the goblin???

[npctext 32929]
text0_0=I've got to hand it to her; she's managed to weasel her way out of another sticky situation! These reports will prove to be invaluable in our dealings with the Blackrock orcs.$b$bOf course, you will be rewarded for your hard work.

[npctext 32930]
text0_0=I... I sense that the souls of those wolves you have put down now have rest. They - and I - thank you for a merciful release.$b$bThe wolves are not alone in their suffering within this damnable place, $N. Please, I have need of you once more.

[npctext 32931]
text0_0=I hear your footsteps, $N. My vision has faded from me, but I still am able to sense things around me. Have you ended the misery of the disease-ridden grizzlies?

[npctext 32932]
text0_0="I know that the grizzles have been put down, their torment at an end. I... I have one more thing for you. I wrote it down on... on this branch, sensing that my time in this realm had come to an end.$b$bIndeed... I am at that end. Thank you again friend... the creatures of this accursed land may rest... and now shall I."$b$bWith that, a heavy sigh is uttered by the $C, followed by what sounds like a death rattle. His body lies motionless on the cottage floor.

[npctext 32933]
text0_0=On behalf of the Cenarion Circle, I bid you welcome to this enclave, $C. What business do you have with us?

[npctext 32934]
text0_0=This is from Mulgris, you say? We had heard he sought to minister to the creatures suffering in the Plaguelands, but this is most unexpected... and most saddening. Mulgris is... was a good friend. I will mourn his passing deeply.$b$bHis efforts have not gone in vain, thanks to your diligence. In this branch, much lore is stored about the plague the Scourge propagates upon the land. We will study it diligently. As for you, please accept this. It is the least we can do for your noble efforts.

[npctext 32935]
text0_0=A package in the barn that you might have otherwise overlooked now stands out amongst the decay and ruin. Perhaps this is the one that the ghost of Janice Felstone was clamoring about...

[npctext 32936]
text0_0=Are you here to seek the assistance of the Undercity census, or just to ask me if someone you knew is dead? I get asked that a lot.

[npctext 32937]
text0_0=A package for a Jeremiah Felstone, with his last known address as Lordaeron... I should be able to assist you.$b$bJeremiah Felstone was in the city before the plague. Well, I should say the former Jeremiah Felstone - some of the Forsaken have changed their last names to rid themselves of their former countenance. This case is no exception; the former Jeremiah Felstone is now known as Jeremiah Payson.$b$bWait a minute... isn't he the cockroach vendor?

[npctext 32938]
text0_0=How goes your search for the supplies, Weegee? I trust the quilboar fall under your strength easily.

[npctext 32939]
text0_0=Haha! Thank you, Weegee! This will help us greatly. You're a boon to the Crossroads and to the Horde. If there is anything I can do for you, please, let me know.

[npctext 32940]
text0_0=I would tell you to get off my lawn, but as you can see I don't have one.

[npctext 32941]
text0_0=My name is indeed Emma Felstone - you're the first person in years to call me that. Who... who are you?$b$bYou say you knew... my sister?! Is she still alive? Who am I kidding, of course she isn't. When the plague broke out in Lordaeron, I had come to expect the worst. So many of my family died... or worse. Here I am now, crazy Ol' Emma, all alone. What are you, a grave-robber or something? Looking for your next target?$b$bWhat... you have a package for me from my sister?

[npctext 32942]
text0_0=Every time someone steps on a cockroach, I cry. Please don't make me cry.

[npctext 32943]
text0_0=I haven't used that name in years... but yes, at one point in my life - before this glorious unlife - that was my last name.$b$bYou claim to have known my sister... or rather, have recently spoken to my sister.$b$bWho's been dead.$b$bFor four years.$b$bYou know, if my bones weren't already brittle enough, I'd be tempted to break my foot off on your posterior. You're quite the vulture, aren't you?$b$b What... you have a package for me from my sister?

[npctext 32944]
text0_0=John, sweetheart... is that you? I'm so cold all the sudden...

[npctext 32945]
text0_0=You give the half-charm back to the apparition. She looks at it, then at you expectantly.$b$b"Honey, where did you put your half of the charm? We can't be together unless we have both halves. Honey... can you see me?"

[npctext 32946]
text0_0=John, don't let the ghouls get you... don't let the ghouls get me... nasty ghouls... our charm will keep us safe.

[npctext 32947]
text0_0=You hand the reassembled good luck charm to Janice Felstone's ghost. As soon as she grasps it, you observe an almost immediate change in her. Her ethereal form shimmers, and she looks upon you with clear yet sad eyes.$b$b"You've freed me... I no longer will need this charm. Please, take it and perhaps it will give you the solace it has given me."

[npctext 32948]
text0_0=This was no easy task, yet you have excelled. But do not be too quick to think you have impressed me, $N.

[npctext 32949]
text0_0=Brumeran calls out to you, Postal.

[npctext 32950]
text0_0=Yes. You have returned. I believe now that you are a true $C by nature. You have faced the most ferocious of creatures and have returned, surpassing my expectations.$b$bYou are now ready for my final request.

[npctext 32951]
text0_0=You have proven both your strength and your determination. Many more challenges await you, but I have already shown you as much as I am able.$b$bGood luck, $N.

[npctext 32952]
text0_0=We learn from our life experiences, $N. From what this marker says, I am sure that you have only become stronger and wiser as a result of yours. You have grown much since we last spoke.$b$bTake this in remembrance of the difficult tasks you have accomplished as a $R $C, and know that you will always have my respect and admiration.

[npctext 32953]
text0_0=So, Motega Firemain sends word of Arikara...well now that is grave news.$b$b$b$bArikara is a deadly creature born only to seek vengeance against those who have committed heinous acts.$b$b

[npctext 32954]
text0_0=Good, you have gathered the essential amount of Incendia agave. This rare herb found only in Thousand Needles will help light the dormant sacred fire of life.$b$b<Magatha begins to enchant the Incendia agave.>

[npctext 32955]
text0_0=Have you discovered what the Grimtotem are up to?

[npctext 32956]
text0_0=Great Spirit Totem! This is dire news indeed. I must begin to plan for whatever may come.$b$bMac, as promised, here is your reward for your brave service.$b$b

[npctext 32957]
text0_0=Welcome to the Plaguelands, hero. This is one of most dangerous frontiers in Azeroth, especially with the looming threat of the Scourge to our north and northeast. I am glad to hear that the clarion call of duty and service to the greater good did not fall on deaf ears with you!$b$bIf you are ready to get your hands dirty, then there is plenty for willing and able heroes to do here on the edge of the Plaguelands.

[npctext 32958]
text0_0=Status?

[npctext 32959]
text0_0=Thanks so much, $N! Now I can get back to work here.$b$bDid you find anything of interest at the Winterfall camp?

[npctext 32960]
text0_0=What is that you have found?

[npctext 32961]
text0_0=You got this from the Winterfall?

[npctext 32962]
text0_0=Inside the cauldron bubbles a rotting, repulsive-smelling substance...

[npctext 32963]
text0_0=I hope you found something, $N. The Winterfall are becoming increasingly aggressive!

[npctext 32964]
text0_0=You are very resourceful, $N. Do you think that the Winterfall furbolgs have been to the Deadwood camp?

[npctext 32965]
text0_0=I think we are beginning to uncover what is happening here, $N.

[npctext 32966]
text0_0=I have to compare this to the substance you found in the cauldron, and then I'm sure we'll know more.

[npctext 32967]
text0_0=We'll see what happens when the Winterfall don't get their firewater!

[npctext 32968]
text0_0=<Donova examines the contents of the crate>$b$bI wonder if consuming this substance makes the furbolg more aggressive. They do seem much larger...

[npctext 32969]
text0_0=Have you slain the vicious serpent Arikara, $N?

[npctext 32970]
text0_0=This does not make sense. Why would Arikara be after Cairne Bloodhoof? Magatha could not be wrong, she is our most powerful $C.$b$b<Motega shakes his head.>$b$bRegardless, your great deed to the Horde shall not go unnoticed - please, choose one of these as a reward for your aid.

[npctext 32971]
text0_0=Welcome to the Plaguelands, hero. This is one of most dangerous frontiers in Azeroth, especially with the looming threat of the Scourge to our north and northeast. I am glad to hear that the clarion call of duty and service to the greater good did not fall on deaf ears with you!$b$bIf you are ready to get your hands dirty, then there is plenty for willing and able heroes to do here on the edge of the Plaguelands.

[npctext 32972]
text0_0=Mission accomplished, $N! Well played, well played.$b$bAllow me to reward your work thus far with some coin from the Stormwind coffers. I'd recommend spending it on materiel that will aid your in your next mission... one that will take you into the ruins of Andorhal itself.$b$bBe ready! Be vigilant!

[npctext 32973]
text0_0=Welcome to the Plaguelands, hero. This is one of most dangerous frontiers in Azeroth, with the looming threat of the Scourge to our east, and then even further still eastward from there. I am glad to hear that the call of duty and service to the Horde did not fall on deaf ears with you!$b$bIf you are ready to get your hands dirty, then there is plenty for willing and able heroes to do here on the edge of the Plaguelands.

[npctext 32974]
text0_0=Once the towers are marked, they'll become top priority targets for our attack on Andorhal. I suspect that once we neutralize the towers, the main threat of Andorhal will emerge. From that point on, we'll have a straight-up fight for control of the city!$b$bYou're back to report success, yes? Don't forget the beacon torch as well; we must maintain control of our materiel.

[npctext 32975]
text0_0=My priests are reporting that our beacon trackers are picking up extremely strong signals on all four towers! Dare I say it, but I believe you've executed another mission with complete and total success! Well played once again, $N!$b$bWith the towers marked, our preparations for the attack are now in place. The time has come to take the fight to the Scourge!

[npctext 32976]
text0_0=Thank you so much, $N. I hope to get back to my studies without worry that I will be ambushed. Please accept this as a reward.

[npctext 32977]
text0_0=Now, what's this, $N?

[npctext 32978]
text0_0=I wonder what all of this means... I can't make anything out...

[npctext 32979]
text0_0=The Emerald Circle is friendly to all, $R. What can I do for you?

[npctext 32980]
text0_0=Yes, if you let me examine this for a while, I might be able to translate it for you.$b$b<Kelek flips through the pages.>$b$bWhen I am able to look over this fully, I will send word to you.$b$bThank you for sharing this with me, $N. Very little is known about the Winterfall furbolg.

[npctext 32981]
text0_0=If you're ready to commit to a permanent decision by becoming a dragonscale leatherworker, then I'm ready to take you on as a student. Just bring to me the things I asked for, and we'll begin your education.

[npctext 32982]
text0_0=I'll hand it to you - it takes a strong will to make a permanent decision like you've just done. I assure you, dragonscale leatherworking will prove to be a profitable and rewarding path for you to follow.$b$bTo train in the art for the future, simply speak to me and I will make available any knowledge that you have yet to commit as yours.

[npctext 32983]
text0_0=Have you any news of that murderous Arnak Grimtotem?

[npctext 32984]
text0_0=Hah! Well, this is excellent news! I was starting to think that he would never be brought to justice!$b$bHere you are, $N... and thanks. News of Anrak's foul deeds boiled my blood!

[npctext 32985]
text0_0=Did you find my doll?

[npctext 32986]
text0_0=You found it! You found my doll! Oh, thank you!

[npctext 32987]
text0_0=My Hypercapacitor! This will keep me busy for a while until I can figure out what it does...

[npctext 32988]
text0_0=Do you have my Hypercapacitor?

[npctext 32989]
text0_0=You saw Pamela? How is she? Is she alive?? Oh, no! Poor Pamela! She was so young, and such a happy child...$b$bShe doesn't know what happened to her father, does she? My brother, Joseph?$b$bNo... she couldn't understand what happened to Joseph. And even if she could, I don't have the heart to tell her...

[npctext 32990]
text0_0=There is something timely about your visit. You're not from the future, are you?

[npctext 32991]
text0_0=What is this? A wedding ring? Let me see...$b$bAh! This ring was once on the hand of a great man, but there is much tragedy in that man's past.$b$bAre you here to help him? It's far too late for him now... but perhaps we can help him in the past!

[npctext 32992]
text0_0=Did you find the book, $N?

[npctext 32993]
text0_0=Well done, you found it!$b$bDid you read it? Is Joseph Redpath mentioned? If he is, then perhaps we can save him!$b$bAh. The Annals of Darrowshire tell a very unsettling tale. It says that during the battle, Joseph Redpath was corrupted and joined the ranks of the Scourge! He then betrayed the defenders of Darrowshire.$b$bThat is an ill fate. If we can, we should try to change that fate, don't you think?

[npctext 32994]
text0_0=Good, $N! With their numbers weakening, we can further press them.$b$bHow was your first taste of their power? Were they as strong as you thought they would be? Stronger? Or perhaps they were no challenge for you at all. Wouldn't that be something?$b$bWe can discuss the details of your exploits later. There are other things we must focus on now.

[npctext 32995]
text0_0=I hope your search goes well, $N. I haven't started heading that far north, but I will admit, the thought of crossing the path of an infernal at any point scares me just a little. The creatures are brainless, but still quite intimidating.

[npctext 32996]
text0_0=Good that you're alive, $N. Bad that the water still exists. I was hoping to find at least one pure source of water here in Felwood. It looks like my search has failed. The process of healing the land could have been made much easier with its existence.$b$bI will have to concern myself with saving what forest creatures I can while destroying those that have become so corrupt that they endanger themselves as much as travelers through this once-mighty forest.

[npctext 32997]
text0_0=Once we have the waters from the Moon Well, we will purify it and use it to extinguish the braziers of protection within Shadow Hold. That should allow me ample time to see into the chambers even deeper and discern who actually leads this... cult.$b$bI pray the Earthmother is with us.

[npctext 32998]
text0_0=This will do nicely, $N.$b$bNow all we have to do besides apply the waters to the braziers is to have it purified. That should not be difficult--it should only require a little travel.$b$bHopefully we can do this quickly.

[npctext 32999]
text0_0=I sense you are not just a simple traveler looking for the path to Ratchet. Come, sit and rest at our camp. Speak to me when you're ready.

[npctext 33000]
text0_0=Ah, you need the water from this Moon Well cleansed. Stopping this force of malice in Felwood seems noble enough, but it is not for me to decide if the water will be purified. I will ask the spirits of water--it will be up to them to decide if the cause is just.$b$bGive me a moment and I will tell them of your plea. I hope they are as sympathetic as I am to your cause.

[npctext 33001]
text0_0=Ah, I see you've returned, $N. Good. Did you find Islen in the Barrens? Or do we have to find another way to accomplish our goals?

[npctext 33002]
text0_0=This should be more than enough water for our purposes.$b$bI'm glad to hear that Islen was able to help us. Her strength with the water spirits has always been a strong one. She is also wise, and rare is it that the spirits do not agree with her purpose. The fact that both of them have blessed our task gives me hope that we are on the right path.

[npctext 33003]
text0_0=It is good to see you, $N.

[npctext 33004]
text0_0=The Aspects insist that we stay out of the affairs of mortals. In this world, however, such a thing is not always possible - especially when one of our own contemptuously disregards such edicts.

[npctext 33005]
text0_0=So it shall be...

[npctext 33006]
text0_0=I am Jeziba, known to many as the Sculptor. What I sculpt, however, are not statues, but heroes.$b$b

[npctext 33007]
text0_0=Hundreds upon hundreds of pages filled with garbled text and symbols make up the brunt of this book.

[npctext 33008]
text0_0=I was able to see you with my spells as soon as the last brazier's flames died. Well done, $N.$b$bI learned a few things before the Shadow Council's warlocks were able to recast their spells. Hopefully it will be enough.$b$bFor now, rest. I will tell you what I've learned in a moment.

[npctext 33009]
text0_0=Do you have the relics, $N?

[npctext 33010]
text0_0=You have the libram and the shield!$b$bTheir history is entwined with the history of Darrowshire, and somehow, I know that fate will bring them together again.

[npctext 33011]
text0_0=Did you find the skull and the sword, $N?

[npctext 33012]
text0_0=You found them! Well done, $N! These relics hold a power I do not fully understand, a power you will one day harness.$b$bThey also bring dark memories to my mind, memories death and treachery, and of the last night of Darrowshire...

[npctext 33013]
text0_0=I begin to wonder if I'll ever escape this cage.$b$bIt's only a matter of time before they sacrifice me to whatever demons they worship. The monsters!

[npctext 33014]
text0_0=The key, you've found it! Please, give it to me and I can finally escape!

[npctext 33015]
text0_0=You were the one who helped Arko escape? I'm so glad you found me. She passed by here not too long ago on her way to Darnassus. She had Lightforge in tow and wouldn't even take time to speak to the druids to be healed. She said it was far too urgent.$b$bBut she did tell me about your encounter with Trey's spirit. What a terrible fate for a Knight of the Silver Hand. She didn't show it, but I know it's tearing her up inside, the thought of losing one of her closest friends.

[npctext 33016]
text0_0=You gather the $C's remains as carefully as you can, recalling that at least his spirit has been released from any pain or suffering that might have been forced upon him.

[npctext 33017]
text0_0=Do you have the skulls? Chromie said they will be critical for her spell, and that spell will give us the chance to save Darrowshire.

[npctext 33018]
text0_0=You found them! Wonderful!$b$bAlthough I don't fully understand how they can help us, I feel their power and I know in my bones that they are linked to my home village of Darrowshire.

[npctext 33019]
text0_0=You've come from the west? How fare the rest of Lordaeron? I know that Anderhol is lost, but has the Scourge yet reached fair Tirisfal?

[npctext 33020]
text0_0=What is this book? The Annals of Darrowshire? That was my home before the war... my home before the battle that destroyed it! Why did you bring me this book?$b$bBut look here! At the end there are pages that tell tales of the days beyond the battle! Here is a passage about me! And one about my brother Joseph! Is this book true?$b$bWe must discover the truth!

[npctext 33021]
text0_0=The poor defenders of Darrowshire cry out to me in my dreams, $N. You must free them!

[npctext 33022]
text0_0=It is good to hear you found the tortured souls of my brethren and freed them. My heart will weep less, knowing at least some of the defenders of Darrowshire no longer wallow in the vile subservience of the Scourge.

[npctext 33023]
text0_0=An access panel to the cauldron remains securely fastened. In order to open it, you will need to find the key.$b

[npctext 33024]
text0_0=The key taken from Cauldron Lord Bilemaw is a perfect fit in unlocking the access panel. A foul stench emanates from the opened panel as an unknown mix of concentrated substances swirl inside the cauldron.$b$bThere is a small spigot that the bottle fits well enough under, allowing you to draw a sample for High Priestess MacDonnell back at Chillwind Point.

[npctext 33025]
text0_0=An access panel to the cauldron remains securely fastened. In order to open it, you will need to find the key.

[npctext 33026]
text0_0=The skeletal key found on the cauldron lord easily slides into a keyhole and then disappears, allowing you permanent access to it. Crude, viscous ichors pulsate through twisted tubes within the cauldrons underpinnings.$b$bThere is a small spigot that the bottle fits well enough under, allowing you to draw a sample for Shadow Priestess Vandis back at the Bulwark.

[npctext 33027]
text0_0=An access panel to the cauldron remains securely fastened. In order to open it, you will need to find the key.

[npctext 33028]
text0_0=The cauldron lord's key unlocks the access panel to this cauldron and then disappears, much like the other keys have for the previous ones you've dealt of. A putrid smelling substance churns violently beneath the platform of the cauldron.$b$bThere is a small spigot that the bottle fits well enough under, allowing you to draw a sample for Shadow Priestess Vandis back at the Bulwark.

[npctext 33029]
text0_0=Welcome back to the relative safety of the Bulwark, $N. What progress on the cauldrons do you have to report?

[npctext 33030]
text0_0=Well done $N - it should take Apothecary Dithers no time at all to analyze this and devise a counter agent to introduce into the cauldron. If we are able to pump out enough of it into the air, we might be able to weaken all the Scourge present here.$b$bThis will no doubt be an ongoing ordeal; we will need to continually hit these cauldrons and introduce our reagents into their mix. Still, if we can keep it up, we will have a huge advantage over Scourge when the time comes for battle!

[npctext 33031]
text0_0=An access panel to the cauldron remains securely fastened. In order to open it, you will need to find the key.

[npctext 33032]
text0_0=The skeletal key found on the cauldron lord easily slides into a keyhole and then disappears, allowing you permanent access to it. Crude, viscous ichors pulsate through twisted tubes within the cauldrons underpinnings.$b$bThere is a small spigot that the bottle fits well enough under, allowing you to draw a sample for Shadow Priestess Vandis back at the Bulwark.

[npctext 33033]
text0_0=We know that each cauldron employs a different mix of reagents to generate its plague-inducing toxin; likewise, we know that we will need to develop a counter agent that is unique for each cauldron. Your sample from Dalson's Tears will be the key to figure out that cauldron's distinct reagent requirement.

[npctext 33034]
text0_0=Ah, there is plenty in here for study. Well done, $N!$b$bFor now, the next step is in our hands. We'll need to produce a list of reagents that, when combined with what is already in the cauldron, will act as its counter.$b$bThe only way we will be able to introduce this is by placing the reagents into the cauldron directly. Apothecary Dithers will have more information on that, so be sure to speak with him as soon as possible.

[npctext 33035]
text0_0=Once we successfully analysis the sample drawn from the Writhing Haunt's cauldron, it will provide us with a third avenue to deliver a devastating counter agent against the Scourge!

[npctext 33036]
text0_0=Another finely executed mission, $N! This makes three cauldrons available to us to turn against the Scourge. If Kel'Thuzad's necromantic dominance over these lands wasn't as strong as it currently is, I'd dare say you'd shut them down completely!$b$bApothecary Dithers will have a report on what this cauldron - as well as the other cauldrons subverted - will require to deliver our counter agent to the plague. With that, the time has come to bring the last cauldron of the west under our influence!

[npctext 33037]
text0_0=An access panel to the cauldron remains securely fastened. In order to open it, you will need to find the key.

[npctext 33038]
text0_0=Cauldron Lord Soulwrath's key disintegrates as it touches the lock on the access panel at the base of the cauldron's platform. A slight clanking noise is heard within, and the access panel swings open to reveal more viscous toxins within the cauldron's framework.$b$bThere is a small spigot that the bottle fits well enough under, allowing you to draw a sample for Shadow Priestess Vandis back at the Bulwark.

[npctext 33039]
text0_0=Gahrron's Withering houses the last cauldron that we need to acquire access to here in the west. Once we have a sample of the plague from that cauldron, we will be able to introduce our reagents into the environment through four separate vessels! The Scourge will be hard pressed to keep us out of all four, even with the power of Kel'Thuzad behind them.

[npctext 33040]
text0_0=Congratulations $N, you've unlocked the last cauldron for us! Apothecary Dithers will soon know what this cauldron requires as far as reagents needed for the mix.$b$bAs for you, I am sure that High Executor Derrington will want to thank you personally for the assistance you've given us. Without you, our struggle against the Scourge would have been nearly insurmountable. I thank you, mighty $C.

[npctext 33041]
text0_0=You've seen Pamela? She's alive?$b$bShe's dead? No! Oh, Pamela! Why does your spirit still suffer in this world. Why are you perished, while fortune keeps me alive? In an instant I would switch places with you and wander dead Darrowshire, a ghost and alone!$b$bAh, but this news cannot change fate. Thank you, $N. Now my duty, my duty to revenge, burns hot as ever.

[npctext 33042]
text0_0=Without Fel'dan, the Shadow Council will hopefully lose focus and start infighting. They will struggle with one another for control and hoard assets for future plans. That will be an opportune time to devastate them and their demon slaves.

[npctext 33043]
text0_0=Earthmother be praised, $N! Thank you! This is a great day, indeed!$b$bThe Shadow Council will be hard pressed to scale to the same levels of power they once held with this blow to their hierarchy. You have done a great thing this day!

[npctext 33044]
text0_0=Be wary, not all supply crates will have survived the destruction of the city. The Scourge dare not touch the water but surely the holy water will not prevent vermin infestations.$b$b

[npctext 33045]
text0_0=Well done, $R. You have proven that while you are tolerant of others, you will stop at nothing to destroy the minions of Kel'Thuzad.$b$b

[npctext 33046]
text0_0=That's true. I'm looking for someone to hunt me some wolves! Are you that person?

[npctext 33047]
text0_0=What have you got there, $N?

[npctext 33048]
text0_0=What will this mean to the Crusade? Could it be possible that they have been under the control of this demon? Unwittingly serving as the pawns to a greater evil?

[npctext 33049]
text0_0=The Baron has slain more people than you have most likely seen in your lifetime.

[npctext 33050]
text0_0=It has been many years since I have ushered a champion into our ranks. You are the first to be granted audience with Lord Maxwell in years.

[npctext 33051]
text0_0=You are a worthy ally, Ama. You shall reap the rewards of your stalwart dedication.

[npctext 33052]
text0_0=Whoa...

[npctext 33053]
text0_0=Alen has finally found someone brave enough, eh?

[npctext 33054]
text0_0=I will pound the steel until the breath itself has been taken from me.

[npctext 33055]
text0_0=This is the final step before you begin your new career as an armorsmith, $N. Should you choose to back out, now would be your last chance. Otherwise, prepare yourself for a lifetime of glory.

[npctext 33056]
text0_0=Has Kerlonian arrived?

[npctext 33057]
text0_0=Oh, I am so happy Kerlonian made it! And I'm sure I'll find him sleeping somewhere around here, won't I?$b$bThank you for showing him the way, $N.

[npctext 33058]
text0_0=Bow your head in my presence, $R. I am a noble, after all, and you are a copperless peasant.

[npctext 33059]
text0_0=Excellent work, $R. Now to secure my inheritance...

[npctext 33060]
text0_0=Bow your head in my presence, $R. I am a noble, after all, and you are a copperless peasant.

text0_0=What news have you, $C! Ah - a message from my brother you say? Well then, hand over the report!

[npctext 33063]
text0_0=I know not what connection you have with my brother but it would seem he has trust with you, $C.$b$bI am Nataka Longhorn and would like to welcome you to Ghost Walker Post, we have many needs of a $C! Talk with others, perhaps there is need of you here.

text0_0=$N, do you have the Demon Box?

[npctext 33065]
text0_0=Ah, the Demon Box. Give it to me, $C, and I shall open... and thus reveal to you the Hand of Iruxos.$b$b

[npctext 33066]
text0_0=With the death of Kirtonos, a chapter in the horrible tale of Scholomance comes to a close. There is, however, more to be done. Others here are now aware of your brave acts. Take this, $N. It is a piece of our own essence. It will allow you to communicate with the other lost souls of Caer Darrow.

[npctext 33067]
text0_0=How did things go in Jaedenar, $N?

[npctext 33068]
text0_0=You've done it! Praise be to Elune and whichever powers you worshihp, $N. You have done an honorable and noble thing this day. I am certain Arko'narin will be pleased that you not only took the time to save her, but to also slay the creature who tortured one of her best friends.$b$bI wish I could do more for you, but please, take this.

[npctext 33069]
text0_0=My hoof tingles and my mouth starts to water when I think of fried Bloodbelly fish... You have any on you?

[npctext 33070]
text0_0=You are a savior, $N! These Bloodbelly fish look almost good enough to eat raw.$b$b<Nataka starts salivating.>$b$bHere you go - choose one of these items as a payment for these fish.

[npctext 33071]
text0_0=No good lazy...$b$b Eh? Do you have my blackjack? Did you catch any peons sleeping on the job?!

[npctext 33072]
text0_0=Good, good. Maybe they'll think twice before slacking next time! Thanks for the help!

[npctext 33073]
text0_0=A keepsake of remembrance is a rare find, $N.

[npctext 33074]
text0_0=I had doubted the possibility of such an item existing. This certainly opens up an incredible opportunity - one we must not squander.$b$bPrepare yourself, $N, for what I am about to ask of you will take you into the depths of hell.

[npctext 33075]
text0_0=Do not ask questions of which you do not want answers.

[npctext 33076]
text0_0=<Leonid looks over the keepsake.>$b$bYour quandary stirs up memories that I had hoped would never resurface.

[npctext 33077]
text0_0=As the soul clung to the keepsake, so shall it cling to the physical form of Ras Frostwhisper.

[npctext 33078]
text0_0=Have you done the impossible?

[npctext 33079]
text0_0=I was certain that you would be joining me as another hapless spirit.$b$b

[npctext 33080]
text0_0=Where's that useless abomination? Either you have what I need or you'd best get out there and find it.

[npctext 33081]
text0_0=What's this? Gloom weed?! I've no need for gloom weed! That mindless mass of flesh is out there picking daisies and convincing the Lady knows how many dupes like you into doing the same. No offense.$b$bVery well, you're here now and that's all that matters. Since I'm not going to bother to try to explain things to that abomination how about you collect what I really need... doom weed!

[npctext 33082]
text0_0=This had better be good. I trust you have all of the doom weed that I require?

[npctext 33083]
text0_0=Ah, my doom weed. Excellent!$b$b<Junior Apothecary Holland rubs his hands together greedily>$b$bThese will come in quite handy. You've done me, uh, the Lady, a fine service today $N. As promised here is the reward that you deserve.

[npctext 33084]
text0_0=Do you have the bones? The caravan will be here any moment. I need just ten more kodo bones to reach a career high. A career high, I tell you!

[npctext 33085]
text0_0=Ah, goodie! My bones!$b$bI can't wait till the chaps at home see my face on the front cover of Goblin'preneur. I'll be the richest goblin in the world... and my physical education teacher said I would never amount to anything.

[npctext 33086]
text0_0=Yeah, I know who you are, and I know why you're here. Dithers sent word to me before you arrived. Let's cut to deal at hand, now shall we?$b$bI've got a mold you can use for the skeleton key, but it will cost you - fifteen gold, up front, no negotiation. I'll pack the skeletal fragments into the mold for you, and I'll also teach you on how to forge the stem of the key without any knowledge of blacksmithing... all free of charge no less.$b$bWho says mercenaries don't offer competitive deals!

[npctext 33087]
text0_0=Dithers said you'd deliver the goods, and deliver you have! A deal is a deal; let me pack the fragments into the mold for you.$b$bDid Dithers imbue them already? Excellent... otherwise, it would have been a long trip back to the Bulwark for you.

[npctext 33088]
text0_0=The bag of horrors!

[npctext 33089]
text0_0=You are the one up to mischief in Blackrock Spire, yes? Do you have what I asked for?

[npctext 33090]
text0_0=Ah, very good. You do not know the evil power for whom you have labored, but now you will know the truth. And fear not--I am no servant of that master. I am Leonid Barthalomew, known as "the Revered" to my brethren in the Argent Dawn.$b$bI tricked Tinkee into sending you and the dragon eggs to me. And it is good that my trick was successful, for had these eggs reached their intended destination, a great power would have fallen into the hands of the enemy.

[npctext 33091]
text0_0=With the Sealed Reliquary of Purity in our possession, it will be possible not only to remove a corrupting threat from the world but also to study it under our judicious watch. Perhaps we can even devise new means to combat the taint of corruption that ever threatens Azeroth.$b$bI know Milli would have had it no other way...

[npctext 33092]
text0_0=It is done, brave $C, and with that the Cenarion Circle is in your debt. Though the war is far from over, a great battle has been won against those who would bring about our doom.$b$bPlease - accept this as a token of our enduring gratitude. Know that you are welcomed here as a hero of the Cenarion Circle for your great deed, $N. Thank you.

[npctext 33093]
text0_0=A Reliquary of Purity is an artifact unto itself. Few were ever made, and almost all of them were thought to have been lost over time.$b$bI admit I have known about the one in Southwind for a little while now. Honestly, with the rising turmoil in Silithus, I thought to keep our secrets just that - a secret. To poke and prod would only cause suspicions of our enemies to rise.$b$bAlas, the time for complacency is at an end, especially with the situation in Eldre'Thalas.

[npctext 33094]
text0_0=Indeed, you are as resourceful as many claim. The Cenarion Circle is blessed to have you working in our stead.$b$bWith the Reliquary once more in our hands, my mind is at ease. I feel more comfortable asking you to not only face down a malfeasant demon, but also to bring back a dangerous item in the process...

[npctext 33095]
text0_0=Get to the Scholomance, $N. Take out those plagued hatchlings before they g

[npctext 33096]
text0_0=Hello, $N! I heard you were here with some dragon eggs? Well, let's see them!

[npctext 33097]
text0_0=There they are! And in such a nice container. The perfect size!$b$bWe'll keep these eggs in a safe place so we can study them later, but right now we need that thing you brought them in.$b$bI have created a device with a very specific use: to destroy the undead scholars of the Scholomance. They are studying dragons in their efforts to create a plagued dragonflight, and we must halt their progress.$b$bI call the device Dawn's Gambit, because... I'm not sure if it works!$b$bWill you find out for us?

[npctext 33098]
text0_0=Well, $N? Where is the rune? You are a good employee, right? You're here to help?$b$bDon't make me think twice about paying you what we agreed upon. What? Oh, we didn't agree on anything? Oh, great... then take your time--just know that it'll be a lot less if you take a long time.

[npctext 33099]
text0_0=Haha! Wonderful!$b$bI'll be sure to find out what this is for and why Magus Rimtori--she's the cow that hired me--wanted it. Hah! I got you now, stinkin' Blood elves! Kim'jael! Ha! I'll teach them who the rats are!$b$bYa did good, $N. Thanks a bundle. Here, take this coin and be off with ya--I've got some things to figure out.

[npctext 33100]
text0_0=Well done, $C. Thank you for your help. The spirits are at peace, and the threats that their desire for the arcane draw have been lessened.$b$bI am sure that both sides of the conflict that ravishes Azeroth will see you are above such things.

[npctext 33101]
text0_0=Well done, $C. I see you're not only skilled but cunning. To defeat such creatures is a testament to your loyalty to the tenants of the Earthmother, even if you do not recognize her as your own deity. She is in all things on this planet and beyond. Her eyes, one dark and one light, travel across the skies always gazing down upon us.$b$bPlease, take this small amount of coin in appreciation for what you have done.

[npctext 33102]
text0_0=Yeah, I know who you are, and I know why you're here. Dithers sent word to me before you arrived. Let's cut to deal at hand, now shall we?$b$bI've got a mold you can use for the skeleton key, but it will cost you - fifteen gold, up front, no negotiation.

[npctext 33104]
text0_0=I hope you're not here for ammo, because I'm almost out!

[npctext 33105]
text0_0=Great, more ammo! Old Loslor's shipment finally came through! The ammo might be late, but just like my grand daddy used to tell me: late's better than never!$b$bThank you much, $N. I already have buyers eager for this stuff!

[npctext 33106]
text0_0=Do not pity the demon dogs, troll. They are abominations!

[npctext 33107]
text0_0=Well done, $N. Come. Rest. Let us eat and talk of days long past!

[npctext 33108]
text0_0=You are a shining example of decency, troll! It has been long since I have felt the blood of heroes pump through my veins. Your acts of bravery are uplifting!

[npctext 33109]
text0_0=You will grow to tolerate the taste, troll.

[npctext 33110]
text0_0=May the Light watch over you! Bless you, young one.

[npctext 33111]
text0_0=That deadline isn't getting any further away, $C. Please hurry and collect those bundles of wood.

[npctext 33112]
text0_0=Excellent! Thanks to you, I should be able to complete the order in time. To show my gratitude, I would like to offer some coin as compensation for your troubles.$b$bThank you and farewell.

[npctext 33113]
text0_0=The caravan will be here shortly; do you have the five new tamed kodos I was asking for?

[npctext 33114]
text0_0=<Smeed Scrabblescrew begins counting.>$b$bThree, four, and five... excellent, I ask for five tamed kodos and I get five tamed kodos... I am going to be rich... yes, very rich! I hope to see the look on Bibbly's green face when he hears about my success!

[npctext 33115]
text0_0=Have you banished the demon portals at Mannoroc Coven?$b$b

[npctext 33116]
text0_0=You are to be commended, $N. Your effort has helped greatly in fighting the demon threat, and all of Azeroth is safer because of it.$b$b

[npctext 33117]
text0_0=Where is my sister Jessica? She left so long ago, when I was just a little girl. She cried so much when she went away. I don't know why she cried! Maybe she fell and hit her toe.$b$bWhen Jessica was here we used to play games and dance and pick pretty flowers around the house. And sometimes we'd hide when we saw daddy coming home, then jump out and surprise him!$b$bCome back, Jessica! If you come back then maybe daddy will too and we can all play together again...

[npctext 33118]
text0_0=I'm glad you've arrived, $N. We have much to discuss about your future and your path within the Light.

[npctext 33119]
text0_0=Excellent, $N With one more healthy guard out there to help the town, we'll be that much safer. I'm glad to see you're already learning to use your abilities wisely. If you feel you are ready for more training at any time, please come back to me. But for now, take this robe. It will let others know that you are one of our order. If you don't want to wear it, that's fine. Later there will be more tests and this robe isn't necessary for those.

[npctext 33120]

If you don't want to wear it, that's fine. Later there will be more tests and this robe isn't necessary for those.

[npctext 33121]
text0_0=Wonderful, you've returned home, $N. It always pleases Tyrande and myself when those we've trained go out into the world and return to us safely. How have things been with you? Does Elune still bless your travels? Perhaps after we speak more about the business at hand, you could tell me more of your travels.

[npctext 33122]
text0_0=Our powers make us ideal for so many situations, $N. You'll find that no matter what though, our ability to mend wounds and increase the amount of damage our companions can take will always be the most desired talents we have access to. Do not let that dissuade you from pursuing other paths as a $C--you can be effective in many ways. But... if you truly wish to destroy your enemies with magical energy, perhaps the arcane is more to your liking.

[npctext 33123]
text0_0=You have passed my test with ease. Good.$b$bSoon, you will be ready to take on more responsibility and that road will lead to darker powers--powers that no $C of another race has.$b$bTake this robe as a symbol of your station. You have earned it. If you do not wish to wear it, then so be it, you may do with it as you will. I and others like us will always acknowledge you for what you've achieved in our ranks.

[npctext 33124]
text0_0=Finally, you've arrived. Your faith alone will not allow you to pass the trials before you, young one. A sense of urgency and some ambition will help too.

[npctext 33125]
text0_0=Ah, good, another has arrived. Time may not matter to me, but to you it is of the essence. There is much for you to learn and there is much I wish to teach you. You simply must prove your worth. Do that, and you shall be greatly rewarded.

[npctext 33126]
text0_0=Ah, good, another has arrived. Time may not matter to me, but to you it is of the essence. There is much for you to learn and there is much I wish to teach you. You simply must prove your worth. Do that, and you shall be greatly rewarded.

[npctext 33128]
text0_0=Elune bless you for returning so quickly to us. This is an important time in your training, and a time that all of our order take very seriously. When you've rested from your journey here, please, let me know. We can then discuss the continuation of your training and where your path will lead you next.

[npctext 33129]
text0_0=Were you able to find anything, $N? Any clues as to why one of her clansman had to die needlessly would be helpful.

[npctext 33130]
text0_0=Excellent, $N. Thank you.$b$bMagatha told me that if you were successful in finding her clansman that you be given this. Please, take it in thanks.

[npctext 33131]
text0_0=There are a hundred other tasks awaiting my attention, $C. Do you have the books?

[npctext 33132]
text0_0=Good, $C. You have done well in serving the Dark Lady. Your continued perseverance and ambition will be of great use to the Lady's subjects. Return to me again in the future. Perhaps I will have other tasks for you that will aid the Dark Lady in her attempts at overtaking the Lich King and completely freeing the Scourge.

[npctext 33133]
text0_0=Do you have the insignia yet, $N?$b$bIt will be a vital tool in you infiltrating what I believe is the greatest threat to the Horde and us finally finding peace in our new home.$b$bYou will learn how intricate a web men and orcs alike can weave when they are motivated by greed and power. The hidden agendas, the corruption, all of it will become clear. You will find yourself in the midst of a war you never knew existed.

[npctext 33134]
text0_0=Good, $N! The spirits be praised, perhaps you are the one who will finally put my greatest fears to rest! Who would suspect someone so young and so brave would rise up and champion our cause? You remind me of myself when I was younger. I will ensure that you are justly rewarded for your efforts if we both survive the coming storm.$b$bBut there is time for more praise later. You've not accomplished anything in comparison to what you will face... but this is a good start.

[npctext 33135]
text0_0=Excellent! Most excellent, $C!$b$bWhat you have done this day is only the first step in a much broader foundation--a foundation that we will build the destruction of the Shadow Council on, once and for all.$b$bTell me all he said... and leave not one word out--it may be more important than you realize.

[npctext 33136]
text0_0=Have you found them yet, $N? The leaders of the Searing Blade.$b$bI knew the Shadow Council sought to take Orgrimmar and all of the Horde from me, but I hadn't realized how quickly they were able to infiltrate the city. So many arms this beast has... we can cut them off until exhaustion sets in, but we will be no further than when we started. I will have to have my spies double their efforts.

[npctext 33137]
text0_0=I am glad you've returned, $N. Some of those loyal to me brought word immediately that the caverns below Orgrimmar were in disarray now that their leaders have been slain. I even heard reports that Neeru was more than agitated. It seems we've put a dent in his armor. I can't say I'm displeased... even with such a minor victory.

[npctext 33138]
text0_0=What is it?! Oh, you, $C... my apologies. My anger rivals that of a rabid kodo bull... but perhaps it is my own fault. In sending travelers into Ragefire Chasm, I should have seen the possibility that some harm would come from it. It seems both Bazzalan and Jergosh were taken unaware and slain by some of Thrall's do-gooders. A most inopportune time, but there is nothing that can be done about it now.

[npctext 33139]
text0_0=Ashenvale? Hmm, I had not heard of any presence of the Council or the Burning Blade in Ashenvale. My spies will investigate, $N. You have done well.$b$bFor now, rest, and keep yourself occupied with other tasks. I will call upon you again soon.$b$bLok-Tar Ogar!

[npctext 33140]
text0_0=Do you have the Sceptre of Light?$b$b

[npctext 33141]
text0_0=The elusive Sceptre of Light! Your acquisition of it has removed a grave threat to the world. Well done, $C, well done.$b$b

[npctext 33142]
text0_0=Please, friend; sit and hear my tale.

[npctext 33143]
text0_0=The Fordring redemption will be a difficult task. Are you prepared?

[npctext 33144]
text0_0=Have you killed the beast? He surely must be the leader of the Searing Blade in Ragefire Chasm.

[npctext 33145]
text0_0=Ha! You've done it! Thrall will be so pleased.$b$bI will ensure this heart is taken care of properly.$b$bFor now though, you must celebrate your victory. I will inform Thrall of your success.$b$bThank you for your aid, $C.

[npctext 33146]
text0_0=Is that desert dust on your collar?$b$bHm... if my nose tells true, I'd say it's not desert dust, it's desert salt!  Been to the Shimmering Flats, have you?

[npctext 33147]
text0_0=Great, my package from Koalbeard! Thank you $N. This crate holds special-gauge ammunition, and it'll serve us well out in the jungle!$b$bHere's your pay, and tell me, how is crusty old Kravel these days? Still up to no good I'd wager...

[npctext 33148]
text0_0=Sit, $C. Soon enough you'll strike back into the jungle.

[npctext 33149]
text0_0=Ah, this horn belongs to a Tauren, Roon Wildmane. He and I had a good time hunting the beasts of Desolace. So Roon is inviting me back, is he?$b$bWe're neck deep in the jungle right now, but thank you, $N. Perhaps my next expedition will take me back to Desolace, the land of the centaurs.

[npctext 33150]
text0_0=Do you have the stem of the skeletal key finished? I'm truly sorry you had to bear the brunt of the fee to purchase the mold, but we must all do our part to counter the Scourge. Once you hand me the unfinished key, you'll be ready for the final item needed to complete its construction.$b$bIt won't be easy at all, but the work you've done to date in preparing for an assault on Andorhal will now start to pay for itself. You'll see.

[npctext 33151]
text0_0=We've got quite the costly skeleton key there, don't we $N? Still, it remains unfinished; the time has now come to put some focus behind our creation. To that end, you're going to have to face the ultimate foe we've been working towards facing in Andorhal... the being that runs the show within the ruined city walls.$b$bI'm speaking of Araj the Summoner - a lich, and one of the most powerful beings the Scourge calls as its own.

[npctext 33154]
text0_0=You've come this far $N - only the destruction of the physical form of Araj the Summoner will provide us with the means to finish the key. Get Araj's scarab, by hook or by crook, and bring it to me - I will fuse it on as the head of the key.

[npctext 33155]
text0_0=Yes, this is it! I... again, I'm absolutely amazed at the depths of your cunning and bravery. It simply boggles the mind the lengths you are willing to go in order achieve victory.$b$bAllow me now to play my small part in this. I've prepared a special solvent that should allow me to secure the scarab on as the head of the key, infusing it with the power to breech the locked door of Scholomance.$b$bThis should take just a moment...

text0_0=Greetings! It is a pleasure to meet you!$b$bI see you have a special voucher. Give it to me and I will offer you something in exchange.

[npctext 33159]
text0_0=You are indeed a special hero, $N. We welcome you to the world of Azeroth, and offer you one of these unique gifts!

[npctext 33168]
text0_0=My faith will guide you, $N. The Light knows no bounds.

[npctext 33169]
text0_0=It is as glorious now - even in its tattered state - as the day I looked upon it and took my oath of allegiance.$b$bHis redemption comes and perhaps mine with it...

[npctext 33170]
text0_0=How could I forget? Many of the spirits on this island are cursed to relive their last happy memory before they met their tragic end.$b$bI too am cursed, but not as they - I am one of the few that remembers all...$b$bPerhaps this thing that you ask me is why I haunt these ruins. Perhaps this thing I tell you shall set me free.

[npctext 33173]
text0_0=The painting, $N. Do you have the painting?

[npctext 33174]
text0_0=<Tirion nearly collapses when he sees the painting.>$b$b<He begins to sob in an almost frenetic manner.>

[npctext 33175]
text0_0=I knew this day would come.

[npctext 33176]
text0_0=I was Tirion's most trusted advisor when he held rank as Lord of Mardenholde. I openly dissented the verdict passed by the Order of the Silver Hand and was banished for my insolence.$b$bHe has been through much heart ache and disappointment in his life, $R. Are you prepared to right the wrongs set upon the Fordrings?

[npctext 33177]
text0_0=Are you the reinforcements from Tyr's Hand?

[npctext 33178]
text0_0=What is this, soldier?$b$b<Taelan opens the box and begins to examine its contents.>$b$bThis... this cannot be true. But all that you have shown me...$b$b<Taelan falls to one knee, his heartbeat quickens. The fury of ages is about to be loosed upon this town.>

[npctext 33179]
text0_0=I'm so worried! Please be careful!

[npctext 33180]
text0_0=I'm so glad you were able to do this for me, $N! Thanks for your help!

[npctext 33181]
text0_0=You have news from Maggran Earthbinder?

[npctext 33182]
text0_0=This is great news; I have been sitting here guarding this hunk of wood for too long. Now I can spend some time with my family... Yippee!

[npctext 33183]
text0_0=Do you have the termites yet, $N? I am sure it is obvious to a smart $C like yourself.$b$bOnce we have enough of them, we'll make sure no one can use the lumber mill ever again!

[npctext 33184]
text0_0=These will do nicely, $N. Thank you.$b$bIf you're ready, we can get on with the next step.

[npctext 33185]
text0_0=The termites are obviously getting restless as you place the barrel on top of the crate.

[npctext 33186]
text0_0="And so it begins, Father Cenarius. And so it begins."$b$bDendrite makes a quick, invisible gesture in the air above him. A slight aura of power falls over him.$b$b"The first perspective of nature you must adapt to is that of the bear. I will put you on the path to understanding this aspect of druidic life, but it is you that must embrace it and propagate it - now and forever!"

[npctext 33188]
text0_0=I am glad you found your way here today, young $C. The time has come for you to take a large step into a much larger world.$b$bInside each of Cenarius' children is the call to serve nature. Animals and plants are our friends as well as our charges. We choose to devote our lives as preservers of balance for their sakes as well as our own. Your first step into this world will be to learn of the ways of the bear, and to learn strength of body and heart.$b$bReady yourself!

[npctext 33190]
text0_0=Dendrite makes another invisible gesture in the air above him as you approach. Another aura of power comes over him, and he smiles ever so slightly.$b$b"I sense wisdom in you, young one, that was not present when we first met. You gaze upon me with strength and knowing intent, though this intent is yet not focused. You will now learn to focus your strength and adopt the nature of the bear into your work."

[npctext 33192]
text0_0=Welcome back, $N. I sense that your first meeting with the Great Bear Spirit is the same as it is with all druids when they first start down the path of the Claw... a little bewildering, but very intense. I know it was that way with me.$b$bThe Great Bear Spirit has been a part of Azeroth as long as Azeroth has existed in the heavens. We tauren listen closely to such spirits, and we all prosper from its purpose. Now, the time has now come for your first test of this purpose. Listen closely...

[npctext 33193]
text0_0=I have been in contact with your friend Carlin. He feels great pain for the doom of his village, but he speaks very highly of you and knows that you can set things right.$b$bOh, but I'm drifting from the subject at hand... $N, do you have the relics I asked for?

[npctext 33194]
text0_0=Ah yes, there they are. Together they weave a powerful spell, one that will raise the spirits of Darrowshire.$b$bWith that spell, and with a little luck, we can save Joseph Redpath!

[npctext 33195]
text0_0=The death of my son at the hands of these monsters will not pass without incident. Take solace in knowing that the Order is reborn.$b$bI now take my place as Highlord of the new Order of the Silver Hand.$b$bThese possessions of my past - they are all that I have to offer for all that you have done. Please, take these as a symbol of my gratitude; all have served me well over the years.$b$bMay we meet again, in better times, and reminisce of days long past... battles hard fought... dreams redeemed.

[npctext 33196]
text0_0=You have finally taken your large step into a much larger world, $N. I sense the teaching of the Great Bear Spirit within you, and I sense that you have received the strength that Lunaclaw possessed.$b$bThere are no further obstacles in your way... let me now teach you what it means to be a $C of the Claw!

[npctext 33197]
text0_0=Well done, $N. I'm amazed you dealt with them so quickly. Thank you.$b$bI have yet to meet anyone that approves of the Scarlet Crusade and their methods. I believe in the Light as much as anyone else in Stormwind, but they've demonstrated that they only want to kill anyone not loyal to their movement... even innocents.

[npctext 33198]
text0_0=Did you find the hideout, $N? Did you take care of Zaeldarr?

[npctext 33199]
text0_0=Great, you got him! And I hope you taught his gang a lesson too!

[npctext 33200]
text0_0=Are you crying? If this is too 'tedious' for you, 'hero,' I recommend that you head back to the Dark Lady and inform her of the horrible mistreatment you received at my farmstead.$b$bNow get out of my sight!

[npctext 33201]
text0_0=Disappointing. I was hoping that I'd be feeding you to my hounds, instead.$b$b<Nathanos sighs.>$b$bWell, at least you they'll have something to eat.

[npctext 33202]
text0_0=Thank you, $N. You've been more help than I could have hoped for. The air here just seems to suck my will. I feel tired, and I can tell I'm not getting any better the longer I'm here.$b$bI'm not really sure how I'm going to infiltrate Hearthglen itself and report on how strong the Scarlet Crusade's presence is.$b$bBut that's another matter, before you leave, here, take this... as payment for your help. Thank you again.

[npctext 33203]
text0_0=This chest buried here is securely locked.

[npctext 33204]
text0_0=Hameya's chest is opened!!

[npctext 33205]
text0_0=You've done it, $N! Thank you!$b$bI'll return to Elling... I mean Stormwind as soon as I can. Here, take this coin, it's the least I can do for you. You're a credit to your people, $N. Thank you and good luck.

[npctext 33206]
text0_0=Ah, $N! It's good to see you again. Do you have the Book of the Ancients?$b$b

[npctext 33207]
text0_0=The long lost Book of the Ancients! I will ensure this book is passed on to the high council. You've done well today, and for that you are to be thanked... as a hero should be thanked!$b$b

[npctext 33208]
text0_0=May the Light guide you in these troubling times, $C. What brings you here to this beacon of hope in the middle of darkness and despair?

[npctext 33209]
text0_0=This... this is a very special book you have brought me. I'd like to tell you that "special" in this case means "unique and quite possibly illuminating", but that remains to be seen.$b$b"Ooooooo?" Who in their right mind thinks this up?$b$bWell now, I've heard of this Umbranse that Gregor spoke of, so this isn't without merit. I'll do my best to decipher it. As for you... please, have this - courtesy of the Argent Dawn. While you are here, perhaps there are some other things you can aid us with.

[npctext 33210]
text0_0=Have you brought the mooncloth, $N?

[npctext 33211]
text0_0=Ah, very good. This mooncloth will be used for garments sacred to our people. Thank you, $N. Now I will train you.

[npctext 33212]
text0_0=A young $C, I see. Yes, I will grant you the skills you need to train and guide your pet. Not only will you be able to teach your pet new abilities, you will now be able to feed your pet, as well as revive it, should it fall in battle.$b$bNow, go, $C. We will speak again, at a later date.$b$b

[npctext 33213]
text0_0=A fledgling $C, I see. Yes, I can bestow you with the skills you need to train and guide your pet. Not only will you be able to teach your pet new abilities, you will now be able to feed your pet, as well as revive it, should it fall in battle.$b$bRemember, Snowdogchar, always respect the balance and live in awe of nature around you. Now, go forth. We shall speak again, at a later date.

[npctext 33214]
text0_0=Greetings young $C, I'm glad to see you ready and eager to learn about the curing of poisons.$b$bWhile most druids in the past were put through pre-planned trials, your work will involve no such thing. There has been a rash of animal poisonings at the Crossroads in the Barrens, and they're unable to bring it under control. Someone there has requested Moonglade for aid, so we are sending you there to aid them. This is no exercise - the work you'll do is quite real. Bear this in mind.

[npctext 33216]
text0_0=Have you got the reagents I need to make the salve? The gazelle aren't getting any better on their own, so we better not tarry in our effort to save them!

[npctext 33217]
text0_0=This is good, Furrburger, so much so that it should be enough to make some ample doses of the salve - at least enough to start to make a difference.$b$bMaking a cure for poisons can be quite difficult at times because each one often requires a very specific antidote to counteract it. Imagine being able to cure a poison at will without having to worry about the exact ingredients of what the antidote must be!$b$bNow, let me get to work on this!

[npctext 33218]
text0_0=You have done well in tending to the sickly gazelles of the Barrens; they are unwitting victims of a greater taint and corruption that is spreading all throughout the land. You $R are most eager to understand the ways of Cenarius; you, like your elders in Thunder Bluff, are proving that the need for balance transcends artificial racial barriers.$b$bFurrburger, you've proven your worth as an friend of nature and the Circle - take this as a symbol of such.

[npctext 33219]
text0_0=Welcome back - I've been following your progress on this lesson since you left, and I must admit I was surprised to learn about the situation at the Crossroads. This does bear some further investigation, as the introduction of such poisons into the environment is most upsetting to the balance.$b$bYou handled yourself with grace under pressure. For that, I can find no better way to reward you with permanent power over poison. Use it well, Furrburger... use it well.

[npctext 33220]
text0_0=We suffer much from the events of the past. Thank you for what you have done to help protect the Timbermaw.

[npctext 33221]
text0_0=Do not leave me waiting, $C.

[npctext 33222]
text0_0=I trust you did not read the registry. Not even you would do something that idiotic...

[npctext 33223]
text0_0=I would not recommend that you take on this challenge alone, $C.

[npctext 33224]
text0_0=Excellent work, imbecile. I shall fashion this fur into something you can use.$b$b

[npctext 33225]
text0_0=Keep this up and I may have to promote you from imbecile to mental deficient, first class.$b$b

[npctext 33226]
text0_0=I can't wait to go fishing with some fresh soft-shelled clam meat; did you bring me the 10 pieces of it I need?

[npctext 33227]
text0_0=Perfect mon, this is just what the witch doctor told me to do for my headache. He says, "Mai'Lahii - go fish. It'll make you feel better"$b$bWell, I feel better already, thanks mon!

[npctext 33228]
text0_0=As sweet as it is hearing the news that the naga have been vanquished, my heart still feels empty. For the rest of my life I will be dedicated to having them all killed.$b$bHere mon, your reward as I promised. It's small in comparison for the gratification of knowing the naga fried for there hated act upon my crew.

[npctext 33229]
text0_0=The Grand Crusader sits safely in the Scarlet Bastion while his forces pour into your lands, desecrate your structures and monuments and murder your people.$b$bThe Dark Lady has commanded that I deal with this insect once and for all. You will become the instrument of the Forsaken's reckoning.

[npctext 33230]
text0_0=Succeed now and you will have almost earned my respect, $C.

[npctext 33231]
text0_0=<Nathanos laughs.>$b$bExcellent! Finally! An opportunity to destroy the Scarlet Oracle!

[npctext 33232]
text0_0=This is unacceptable, soldier!

[npctext 33233]
text0_0=Where have you been? We had thought the Scourge had captured you.

[npctext 33234]
text0_0=The fools! My deception went unnoticed! Prepare yourself, $C. We must strike with cold cunning!$b$b

[npctext 33235]
text0_0=What is your status, $N?

[npctext 33236]
text0_0=They will be reeling from this blow for years! Well done, $N! You have earned not only my respect but also this reward.

[npctext 33237]
text0_0=Do you have the beasts head yet, $N? It will pay for its crimes. I don't care if it's corrupt or just angry for living in such a dismal forest. No furbolg will live for long committing such crimes against my family!

[npctext 33238]
text0_0=You bring honor to me for following through with your word. My husband died in battle--he would have been proud of that. But I could not rest until I knew that the creature that has forced me to live my life alone paid for what it had done.$b$bThank you again, $N.

[npctext 33239]
text0_0=After Sylvanas freed me, I hunted the beast across these wastes for months. It fled to the safety of Stratholme. The bastard...

[npctext 33240]
text0_0=Do you have my receipt book? I can't wait to get back to business!

[npctext 33241]
text0_0=There it is! And oh my! I forgot how full it was!$b$bThis is a glorious day, $N! Stupendous! Insanely good, I say!

[npctext 33242]
text0_0=You look like you're in a hurry. Well, then you came to the right place!

[npctext 33243]
text0_0=You have to get this note to Stormwind? That's not a problem, you can take one of my gryphons!

[npctext 33244]
text0_0=It is a tragedy. I think... I believe that our kind is cursed, Ama. We are cursed to lose our greatest warriors; our most noble heroes; our most gifted scholars.$b$bWe are indebted to you and I assure you, Ama, wherever Nathanos Marris is now, he smiles down upon you.

[npctext 33245]
text0_0=Is that sweat on your brow, lad? You've been running too much. Next time, take a gryphon!

[npctext 33246]
text0_0=A crate for Westfall, eh? Have you been to Westall before? If so, then it's no problem, my friend. I have plenty of gryphons trained to fly that route!

[npctext 33247]
text0_0=You've been traveling, eh? Have you been anywhere interesting?

[npctext 33248]
text0_0=Ah, a note from Quartermaster Lewis? I'm not surprised he needs more gear. Sentinel Hill is far away, in a land Stormwind has all but forgotten.$b$bWell thank you, $N. Here's some money to cover your travel costs.

[npctext 33249]
text0_0=This is most excellent news! Tell me again how you cast fear into the cold hearts of those vile harpies. The Bloodfuries have been dealt a serious blow!

[npctext 33250]
text0_0=Bloodfury Ripper is a nasty creature! You will have success finding her along the western hill line in the Charred Vale.$b$bThe bloodfuries will be helpless with out... surely we can vanquish them forever!

[npctext 33251]
text0_0=Already I feel the anger leave me. What will I do with my time? Knowing evil moves near my land kept my thoughts moving, though now they are silent. Perhaps this is a good thing... maybe now I can focus on the good, as all Tauren should.$b$bPlease accept this as a reward for your troubles.

[npctext 33252]
text0_0=Besseleth is a ruthless predator... I fear for those that travel Webwinder Path at night. It's then that she and her children prey upon innocent travelers. I myself fell prey to her two-foot fang of death, but luckily I was able to fend her off and get to safety. I would give anything to see that monster destroyed.

[npctext 33253]
text0_0=Good hunting, $N! Besseleth is an old predator in these parts... I will miss her not. Take this reward as a token for being the forest champion.$b$b<Maggran rubs the wound caused by Besseleth.>$b$bPerhaps now many more will travel to Sun Rock Retreat without fearing what lurks in the dark.

[npctext 33254]
text0_0=You're back from Stormwind? Did Osric send the armor?

[npctext 33255]
text0_0=Great, you brought the armor! We'll get this divvied to those who need it immediately.$b$bThank you, $N. Your efforts have been a great help to us. And now that you're no stranger to gryphons, I hope you'll come and lend your aid to Sentinel Hill often!

[npctext 33256]
text0_0=The continuous destruction caused by war and those that seek a profit from lumber pains me deeply. The least I can do is perform the cycle of rebirth and sow the Gaea seeds to replenish the lands with a new forest. Do you have the required Gaea seeds, $C?

[npctext 33257]
text0_0=Ah $N, you have the Gaea seeds. Watch and you shall see the power that these seeds will do for the land. Only those pure and true can heal the land$b$b<Tammra begins to chant.>

[npctext 33258]
text0_0=How may I help you? Are you in need of transport?

[npctext 33259]
text0_0=Ah, you wish to get this to Auberdine? Very well...

[npctext 33260]
text0_0=Have you come from Teldrassil? Tell me, how is the fishing there?

[npctext 33261]
text0_0=A package from Nessa? Thank you, $N! She told me she would send me samples of the fish caught near Rut'theran village. She thinks they may be very different from the fish caught here...$b$bMy! This jawbone is nearly twice the size of the same fish found here. And these scales are as big as a closed fist! Amazing!

[npctext 33262]
text0_0=$N, you're back from Auberdine? Did you speak with Laird?

[npctext 33263]
text0_0=This is very interesting. The fish here are large, but I didn't think the difference in bounties between here and the mainland was so great. There must be a reason for this...$b$bWell thank you, $N. I will discuss with the villagers the news you brought. Perhaps, one day, we will find the root of this oddity. But until then, we shall reap its benefits!

[npctext 33264]
text0_0=Yes, I have need of a courier who will take a package to Darkshore. Will you help me?

[npctext 33265]
text0_0=Greetings, $C. What can I do for you?

[npctext 33266]
text0_0=You need to take this to the Crossroads, eh? That's not a problem. If you've already been there and spoken to Devrak, then you can take one of my wind riders back to him.

[npctext 33267]
text0_0=$N, you are back from Thunder Bluff? Did you deliver the hides to Ahanu?

[npctext 33268]
text0_0=Ahanu sent me finished products? Very good. There are many hunters and adventurers in the Crossroads now and business is lively. I am sure I'll sell these goods very soon.$b$bThank you for all your efforts, $N. I am in your debt.

[npctext 33269]
text0_0=These seeds you plant are strong, resisting corruption, and making a foothold for other life. They will grow and grow, first preventing corruption and healing the scarred land, and then one day, restoring Stonetalon to a lush forest, once again.$b$bHave you planted all of the Gaea seeds?

[npctext 33270]
text0_0=This is great victory for the land. In time, other things will come to pass: the Venture Co. will pack up their buzz saws and axes, the angry fire spirits will calm, and the harpies will be pushed out by the land.$b$bOnly then $N, will Stonetalon be truly at peace.$b$bYou have done well $C; take one of these items as thanks for the new life you have created here today.

[npctext 33271]
text0_0=Have you had your fill of Thelsamar so soon? Are you ready to leave for another city?

[npctext 33272]
text0_0=You have to get this to Ironforge, eh? For a small fee I can put you on the back of one of my gryphons, and it'll take you there. How does that sound?

[npctext 33273]
text0_0=Vous avez l'air d'avoir besoin d'aller quelque part. Vous avez besoin d'un de mes gryphons ?

[npctext 33274]
text0_0=You have to get these to Thelsamar, eh? That won't be a problem. As long as you've already been to Thelsamar and spoken to Thorgrum Borrelson, then you can take one of my gryphons back to him.

[npctext 33275]
text0_0=What can I do for you, sir?

[npctext 33276]
text0_0=Ah, the lastest list of Brock's best pupils. I have a batch of honorary picks ready to go. I just need to chisel in the names of the students...

[npctext 33277]
text0_0=Ah, $N. Have you returned from Ironforge?

[npctext 33278]
text0_0=You brought the picks. Great! I'll get these to my mining students. I'm sure they're eager to use them on the ore deposits of Loch Modan.$b$bThank you for your help, $N. I am in your debt, but I hope this money will at least cover your travel costs.

[npctext 33279]
text0_0=The Tribunal of the Tides grows impatient. They seek to end this war that has raged across all dimensions for eons. My brethren are anxious to hear news of the glorious victory over the hated fire elementals. Have you the Incendrites that I require?

[npctext 33280]
text0_0=The water spirits within me bubble with the excitement. $N, you have given me a glorious victory to report to the Tribunal of the Tides.$b$bFor your efforts, I reward you with a choice of my prized possessions.

[npctext 33281]
text0_0=Have you entered the Burning Blade Coven, Guage? Did you find my pick?

[npctext 33282]
text0_0=Great, you got it! Thanks a lot, Guage. This is my favorite pick! Now if my peons ever finish chopping down these trees, maybe we can find a nice cave to mine!

[npctext 33283]
text0_0=We must respect our dead, $N. It is one of the ways in which we differ from the Scourge...

[npctext 33284]
text0_0=You have done a good deed today, Ganis. Although our struggle against the Scourge continues, let us hope that Marla and Samuel will find peace together in their final resting place.

[npctext 33285]
text0_0=My goodness, my niece Kaya is alive! That is good news indeed. Thank you, $N.$b$b

[npctext 33286]
text0_0=What news have you discovered from Boulderslide Ravine? I recall some legend that deals with Resonite... I just cannot place my hoof on it. Perhaps knowing what lies at the bottom of the cave will illuminate their devious intentions.

[npctext 33287]
text0_0=Ah... Yes! That's it; the Resonite crystals have a trace of Earthen magic. The Kobolds must have dug deep uncovering an Earthen.$b$bLegend states that the Earthen are creatures created by the Titans. They were used to create the land our feet walk on. This most definitely is a threat that cannot be ignored.$b$b<Mor'rogal shakes his head.>$b$bPerhaps I can enchant these ore samples to use against this Kobold plot.

[npctext 33288]
text0_0=I hope you can be quick about getting those horns, $N. I'm heading back to Ratchet soon!

[npctext 33289]
text0_0=These are perfect, $N! Thanks for helping me out!$b$bOh, and this is for your time...

[npctext 33290]
text0_0=Hey mon, have you slain the hairy blood feeders? I fear none here in Stonetalon but I don't go walking around here at night... if you know what I mean mon!$b$bAs long as I stay off there dinner plate then all is well.$b$bGood luck to you, $C!

[npctext 33291]
text0_0=Sweet, mon! Good news, perhaps we will have fewer unwanted dinner gusts tonight.$b$bAs I said earlier, we are in your debt... maybe you would care for one of these for your deed?

[npctext 33292]
text0_0=Did you find the charms, $N? Every moment the furbolgs possess those sacred items, my blood boils with rage!

[npctext 33293]
text0_0=You found them! Thank you! Thank you, $N! You do not know how great a thing you have done for me.$b$bA troll without his charm is like an orc without his battle scars...$b$bWorthless.

[npctext 33294]
text0_0=You bear good news, $C! I fear the possibilities of what an Earthen would mean to Kalimdor.$b$bSlaying Goggeroc was a task for no one less then a hero. You have done well; all of Stonetalon and Kalimdor are indebted to you, noble $C.$b$bAccept this as your reward most honored one.

[npctext 33295]
text0_0=I await reports of your outrunner kills, $N.

[npctext 33296]
text0_0=Very good, $N. Your hunting skills are impressive...$b$bThe loss of those outrunners help blind the Alliance, and when they lack intelligence they are less likely to launch attacks.

[npctext 33297]
text0_0=I hope you find the pages soon, $N! I really need to get back to work!

[npctext 33298]
text0_0=Reading isn't my strong point... but now I'll be able to get back to work! Thanks, $N!

[npctext 33299]
text0_0=Have you found the Ambassador, $N? Is he dead?$b$bWe cannot afford to allow the Scourge to take a foothold on Kalimdor. They are enough of a threat to our own borders to have to deal with them on two fronts.$b$bThe only optimistic sign from the events you've told me about is that the crone seemed uncorrupted. She must know deep in her spirit that the Scourge may bring great power, but that the Barrens would not truly be hers if she were to agree to their deal.

[npctext 33300]
text0_0=Good. Well done, $C.$b$bNow that Malcin is dead, we can at least know that the Scourges advances will be halted. The Dark Lady thanks you for your efforts and wishes to reward you with a gift.$b$bAlthough we do not know the extent of the Scourges influence within the Downs, I am sure we will discover their plots soon enough.

[npctext 33301]
text0_0=What business is it you wish to speak of, $N? You must feel it is important if you continue to pester me.

[npctext 33302]
text0_0=I recognize the insignia on this scroll, $N. You found this on that crone who reigns over Razorfen Kraul? Interesting.$b$bThe Scourge aren't content with one continent it seems. This Ambassador Malcin--the one who wrote the note--is one of the Scourge's plagued servants, a human diplomat to the kingdom of Lordaeron before things... changed.$b$bIf the Scourge are trying to gain a foothold in Kalimdor, then it is up to us to act.

[npctext 33303]
text0_0=Kaya is alive! $N, I have you to thank for rescuing her.$b$b

[npctext 33304]
text0_0=Ashenvale is a divided land, but our most recent efforts have been very successful. We not only have an outpost at the Zoram Strand, but another just north of here called Splintertree.

[npctext 33305]
text0_0=So Torek's attack was successful! Well done, $N. Night elves are decent foes. A little skinny, but strong and fierce! I'm sure the battle was something to see...$b$bAnd I hope you gained a scar or two!

[npctext 33306]
text0_0=Have you killed them yet?

[npctext 33307]
text0_0=$N, I thank you... but I will never forget what the Grimtotem have done to my village.

[npctext 33308]
text0_0=Tsunaman sent you? Excellent. Then we have matters to discuss.

[npctext 33309]
text0_0=How goes your search for the crystals, $N? Have you witnessed the naga harvesting them? I pray to my ancestors we find the reason they are collecting such things.

[npctext 33310]
text0_0=Well done, $N. These are the crystals I spoke of. Intriguings...$b$bI can feel the power within them. The spirits of water cling to them. Whatever the naga were going to use these for... well, let us be glad they are no longer in their hands.

[npctext 33311]
text0_0=Yes, $N? What is it you need? There is still much I must learn about the crystals the naga are gathering.

[npctext 33312]
text0_0=This is interesting indeed. I am glad you have brought it to my attention.$b$bNow we have a name for our troubles... Lorgus Jett.

[npctext 33313]
text0_0=Very good!! Thank you, $N. We may not have stopped the Twilight's Hammer completely, but at least you have staved off another of their plans to return the Old Gods to power.$b$bWho knows what other plans they have manifesting, but we can rest easy for now.

[npctext 33314]
text0_0=Patience, $N. Pay attention!

[npctext 33315]
text0_0=Are you prepared to take on this task?$b$b

[npctext 33316]
text0_0=There is but one way into the dragon's lair, $R.$b$bYou see, only the strongest of the Black Dragonflight are allowed entry into the lair of the brood mother. Many trials must be passed and the key to enter ceremoniously enchanted by General Drakkisath himself!$b$bSince you are not of black dragonkin, you may have some difficulty in obtaining passage.$b$b<Rexxar grins.>

[npctext 33317]
text0_0=It is not often I see one of the Horde in these parts of Lordaeron. What is it that you have for Myranda?

[npctext 33318]
text0_0=<Myranda holds the note, pauses, then smiles.>$b$bHow is he? Rexxar, I mean. Oh, come now, do not look so confused. The letter was left intentionally blank. It carried with it the intentions and thoughts of its creator. Judging from its contents, it is no wonder Rexxar left it as such. Imagine if you were captured or slain and this information discovered!$b$bOh, nevermind! Myranda will help you, $R. I owe the Warchief a favor or two.$b$b<Myranda smiles.>$b$b

[npctext 33319]
text0_0=The eyes of that which we wish to mimic are the most important ingredient of any illusion, $N.$b$b$b$b

[npctext 33320]
text0_0=Let Myranda have a look, $R.$b$bOh yes, these will do nicely.$b$bWith these reagents, Myranda will create for you a medallion that will grant an illusion capable of fooling the black dragonflight's gatekeeper.

[npctext 33321]
text0_0=Have we run so low on able soldiers that Nefarian is sending me whelps? You will never pass my tests, broodling.

[npctext 33322]
text0_0=I hope you can come through with the supplies!

[npctext 33323]
text0_0=Excellent, Friar. You've saved me a lot of work!$b$bBut don't think that I'm not grateful!

[npctext 33324]
text0_0=One of ssseveral complete...

[npctext 33325]
text0_0=Do not return here until you have bathed in the blood of our enemies and drank in their suffering.

[npctext 33326]
text0_0=Another complete...

[npctext 33327]
text0_0=Ironically, whelp, time is of the essencccce.

[npctext 33328]
text0_0=The most hated remainsss...

[npctext 33329]
text0_0=Changesss... I sense them taking place in you, whelp. Pass this test and only ceremony remains.

[npctext 33330]
text0_0=I had doubted your dedication, whelp. You persisted, dominating our enemies, bringing honor to our flight.$b$bI must now prepare the skulls for your ascension.

[npctext 33331]
text0_0=Do not panic, $N!

[npctext 33332]
text0_0=It is merely dragon-talk, $N - more hot air than actual substantive information. Pompous, aggressive behavior is to be expected from their kind. $b$b

[npctext 33333]
text0_0=Well, hi there! So Meggi told you of the trouble I have found here?

[npctext 33334]
text0_0=Ah, $C. I see that there is hope yet. Are you here to assist me?

[npctext 33335]
text0_0=Ah, so Harlo be sendin' you? Well, den, who might you be? I s'pose you be wantin' my help?

[npctext 33336]
text0_0=<Dirge spits out some leather sandal bits.>$b$bPfftooey...$b$b<Dirge hacks loudly.>$b$bWhat? I'll have you know that leather is surprisingly high in protein and low in carbohydrates.

[npctext 33337]
text0_0=Did you defeat Chief Murgut, $N? Did you retrieve his Foulweald Totem?

[npctext 33338]
text0_0=Good work, $N. Issuing that challenge to the Foulwealds and defeating their leader sends them a strong message:$b$bThe Horde is not to be trifled with.$b$bI don't believe that tribe will giving us much trouble for a long time.

[npctext 33339]
text0_0=Life is full of questions, $C. You will never be able to answer all of them, but with some time and study, perhaps you will become a little more knowledgeable.

[npctext 33340]
text0_0=Well done, $C. You have studied the text I asked you to, and now you have passed another of our tests.

[npctext 33341]
text0_0=Well done, $N. I had my doubts if you studied the text I asked you to get, but you've answered correctly.

[npctext 33342]
text0_0=Grundig Darkcloud is dead! $N, I will always be grateful for what you've done here today.

[npctext 33343]
text0_0=I have witnessed many naga attacks since I arrived here. It puts my mind at ease that Vorsha will no longer roam freely.$b$bWe are in your debt, $N.

[npctext 33344]
text0_0=Yarrr... Swabby, what be takin' ye so long?

[npctext 33345]
text0_0=These'll werk nicely, matey. Me brother needs em still tickin' and kickin,' else they go sour... Ye don't want to taste no sour rat kabob.

[npctext 33346]
text0_0=$b$bAlive and kicking... and just in time!

[npctext 33347]
text0_0=Poor Monty. Ever since the Gnomeregan incident, he hasn't been the same. That boy has never seen an ocean in his life, let alone being some kind of pirate.$b$b<Nipsy sighs.>$b$bAt least he keeps the flow of twitching critters coming.

[npctext 33348]
text0_0=Yes, it is time, $C.

[npctext 33349]
text0_0=Why, hello there! Hrmm...$b$bLet me be a little honest with you, friend... you smell a bit ripe. Whiffy, one might say. Now I'm not making a personal assailment of your being. I'm just saying... in the future, you may want to freshen up a little after coming in from the field. It will make those first impressions a little more positively impressionable!$b$bAnyhoo... what can I do for you?

[npctext 33350]
text0_0=Well great monkey toads! What have you got here? It's sort of book shaped, I guess... I'll try crack this shell on it.$b$bLayo sent you to me from Silithus? I've only heard very hushed rumblings - which I guess aren't all that hushed when you think about it - about the horrors that are going on out there. Couple that with my lack of pleasure for anything bug-like, and you've got the recipe for me needing to stay here with the books!

[npctext 33351]
text0_0=Ah, $N - I had hoped you would stop by. I am glad to see you well.$b$bI received notice you would be coming in from the field, and I wanted to personally express the Cenarion Circle's gratitude for the assistance you've given us thus far. No doubt there are more secrets to uncover from Silithus; your delivery to Umber should prove most interesting once uncovered. Please, accept this as a token of our continued appreciation for your aid.$b$bThank you, generous $C.

[npctext 33352]
text0_0=Have you been successful in locating the fathom core? Without it we'll have no idea what the Twilight's Hammer is exactly up to down there.

[npctext 33353]
text0_0=This is exactly what I need! A fathom core is an incredible well of information that we will be able to draw much good from. Whatever the Twilight's Hammer is up to in there - and believe me when I say it is no good - my comrades and I will now uncover.$b$bYou've done well here today; the Earthen Ring looks upon you warmly for assisting us. You've also helped the Horde as a whole, and for that you should be proud.

[npctext 33354]
text0_0=Ho ho hello. I am Greatfather Winter, and I - courtesy of the fine folks of Smokywood Pastures... "Fresh from our farm to your plate, it's Smokywood Pastures wholesome goodness" - would like to wish you a fantastic Feast of Winter Veil.$b$bIf you've been good this year, maybe you will receive treats from Smokywood Pastures as your treat for the Feast of Winter Veil. Huzzah.

[npctext 33355]
text0_0=All this talk of treats has given me a hankering for some myself. Mmmm... gingerbread cookies and milk...

[npctext 33356]
text0_0=You're quite the helper to ol' Greatfather Winter there, $N. Have a great Feast of Winter Veil.$b$bHere's a little something... you know, for the effort.

[npctext 33357]
text0_0=Y-y-you can h-h-hear me! Thank the b-b-bottom line!$b$bI'm not really a s-s-snowman - my n-n-name is Sacks, and I w-w-work for the Orgrimmar b-b-branch of Smokywood Pastures... I g-g-got sent out here to look for a m-m-missing package, when I was attacked by a c-c-creature I have never seen b-b-before!$b$bSo v-v-very cold...

[npctext 33358]
text0_0=The Feast of Winter Veil, you say? Alas, in times past it held a more substantial meaning to us $R. Nowadays, it seems as though others have turned the legend of this season of renewal into something that helps to sell candies and presents.$b$bIt's no surprise that Furmund is bitter about that sort of change. He and other tauren like him cling to our past like a banner of war. While I think a little celebration is always good, it is important to remember the origins of the Feast.

[npctext 33359]
text0_0=Ho ho hello, adventurer!$b$bThe goblins told me that you have earned a special gift this holiday season, and I am pleased to give it to you. Here you go - have a wondrous Feast of Winter Veil this and every season in the future.

[npctext 33360]
text0_0=Don't ask questions!$b$bYou have my request.

[npctext 33361]
text0_0=Ha ha ha! I knew you'd be back.$b$b<Willow mutters>$b$b...So easy to convince.$b$b...Will do anything for the right price. Heh heh heh...

[npctext 33362]
text0_0=If you are able to heal the plant, it will again begin to grow. We must do what we can, $N...

[npctext 33363]
text0_0=Thank you for returning this, $N. With the remaining liquid you brought me, I can continue my studies.$b$bWhile there is still much to do, you have helped to heal some of the corruption that Vyletongue spread through Maraudon. Please take this with my gratitude.

[npctext 33364]
text0_0=Y-y-you can h-h-hear me! Thank the b-b-bottom line!$b$bI'm not really a s-s-snowman - my n-n-name is Sacks, and I w-w-work for the Orgrimmar b-b-branch of Smokywood Pastures... I g-g-got sent out here to look for a m-m-missing package, when I was attacked by a c-c-creature I have never seen b-b-before!$b$bSo v-v-very cold...

[npctext 33365]
text0_0=I have awoken from a nightmare that seemed it would never end...

[npctext 33366]
text0_0=Now that you have recovered the two parts of my scepter, I have hope that Maraudon may one day be rid of the Vyle corruption.

[npctext 33367]
text0_0=I bid you welcome to the Kingdom of Ironforge, friend. I always take an interest in those who choose to take an interest in the kingdom, its people, and its lore. Is this why you are standing before me?

[npctext 33368]
text0_0=The legends and lore surrounding the Winter Veil are ones that have faded from the forefront of public though over the years. While I recognize that the goblins are helping to revive the season for their own ends, the fact that the citizenry thinks about it at least in some form does good to keep such lore alive.$b$bYour desire to go beyond the material and learn about our past is an admirable trait, young $C. I salute your erudite nature.

[npctext 33369]

[npctext 33372]
text0_0=This is most wonderful news, $N! Thank you!$b$bI will speak with Marandis and ask his wisdom on the topic of Zaetar's remains, but at least you have overcome the hardest of the tasks.$b$bI was told that if we were successful in our mission, I had permission to reward those who aided us. I was given these items as tokens from our people--you may choose one.

[npctext 33373]
text0_0=What did you decide, $N? Can you help me? Will you set foot on holy ground to help me forge one great centaur tribe!?

[npctext 33374]
text0_0=This is it, $R! This is it! Now I can begin the great task of uniting the tribes. Thank you.$b$bTake this for your efforts, please. I hope when next we meet, it will be on much different terms.

[npctext 33375]
text0_0=You find the crystals yet? Rituals of power, spells of great strength--those shadowshards maybe very helpful in all kind of arcane magics.

[npctext 33376]
text0_0=Ah, these be perfect for me magics. Here, you take one of these trinkets and be on your way... me got much studyin' to do.

[npctext 33377]
text0_0=$b$bShow them to me!

[npctext 33378]
text0_0=Wonderful! I will have these sent by courier to the Undercity at once!$b$bAs for you - here is payment, as promised. Keep the change, you filthy beast!$b$b

[npctext 33379]
text0_0=I regret nothing, stranger. The Queen has long since passed. The works of the Shen'Dralar have been marred by the madness of Prince Tortheldrin. I seek only freedom... Escape...

[npctext 33380]
text0_0=You have found it! A curse upon that miserable imp. Alas, my material possessions are meager at best. You may choose from what I have to offer.

text0_0=$N, do you have Lethtendris's Web?

[npctext 33386]
text0_0=You have done well, $N. This web holds within it vast stores of the magic of Dire Maul, and I fear what damage may be unleashed if those energies were harnessed by one so irresponsible as Lethtendris. I am saddened by her death, but I know that she could never part with her web while alive.$b$bThank you, $N. I will send the web to students of magic more responsible than Lethtendris. They will be the new wardens of its power.

[npctext 33387]
