text=My former Master, I write to you so that you might know what your apprentice has been doing of late.  Paying heed to your advice, I sought to build my knowledge and wisdom through travel outside the gates of our beloved Stormwind.  My journeys took me to many places but I have decided to take up residence here in the lovely town of Moonbrook.  The surrounding fields of Westfall are most beautiful as the harvest approaches.

[page 17]
text=Within just a few days of my visit I found myself tutoring the local children from the nearby farmlands.  The lessons went so well that the town mayor commissioned me to run a school and construction has begun on a brand new schoolhouse!  From Silverpine to Stormwind and now Moonbrook -- who would have guessed I would see so much of Azeroth!

text=Word of your need for a tutor for your children has traveled to me here in Goldshire, where I take up temporary residence in the Lion's Pride Inn.  Due to the unfortunate state of events in the region, I was forced to abandon my post as Headmaster of the Moonbrook Schoolhouse.  Please accept my application to serve as tutor for your offspring.  Headmaster Crillian of the Academy can speak to you of my abilities if necessary.

I couldn't help but to notice her captivating beauty as well.  She is on the cusp of womanhood now.  Supposedly the Lord has arranged her marriage for next year.  But I digress.  This week I will accompany the family to their summer cottage near the Eastvale Logging Camp in Elwynn, close to the Red Ridge Mountains.  I hope to write more while there.

text=The loss of Stonewatch Keep was very grave.  In previous reports I detailed for you the alliance between the Blackrock Clan of Orcs and the Warlock known as Morganth.  The Blackrock Orcs fought with horrific savagery, undoubtedly fueled by the evil magic of Morganth.  Many of His Majesty's most valiant soldiers perished trying to defend the Keep but ultimately nothing could be done.
text=

[page 32]
next_page=33
text=Oddly enough, Morganth turned on his Orcish cohorts shortly after their wretched victory.  The Warlock constructed an arcane tower in the Northeast, and has used his powers to build a small army of Shadowhide Gnolls to serve his malicious biddings.  Both Orc and Man have fallen victim to the viscous brutes that serve the Warlock.  As to what betrayal took place between Morganth and Gath'Ilzogg, the Blackrock Warlord, one can only speculate at this point.

[page 33]
next_page=34
text=To our peril, the foul Orcs seem more concerned with the demise of His Majesty's good citizens.  In the last fortnight the Blackrock Clan staged a ruthless offensive on Lakeshire.  Many brave men lost their lives that grim day.  The Orc forces advanced with such speed and fury that the bridge spanning Everstill was brought to ruin.  Our war supplies have greatly dwindled.  We lack bandages to mend the wounds of the fallen.
text=

[page 34]
next_page=35
text=Now I ask of His Majesty to support the good people of Lakeshire in this time of need.  We are in need of new soldiers to defend the territory as well as new instruments of war to replace those lost on the battlefield.  Food and building supplies run low as well.  Please, my Lord, help us keep the final bastion between Man and wretched Orc thriving.  The Enemy must be kept out of the Kingdom of Stormwind.
text=

text=I fear a greater and darker evil brewing in the cauldron of corruption that the Northlands have become.  It is imperative that the Kingdom of Stormwind take action lest we seek to become fading memories to the living or slaves to the Enemy.

text=
text=But I owe you.  The Defias Brotherhood is larger than you think.  Every mine from Westfall to Elwynn Forest is under their control.  Kobolds and Gnolls have been enlisted to do their dirty work.  They have goblins crafting metal monsters to place in the Westfall fields to prey on the superstitions of the local residents.
text=

[page 39]
text=They have a vast underground network built.  Bigger than you know, Stoutmantle.  From Booty Bay right to Stormwind Keep.  You may be a brave Paladin but you are a fool if you think you can shut them down.  They are working on a weapon of mass destruction.  After all, if there's one thing Stonemasons know, it's how to build big.  You didn't think this was about pumpkin farms and vineyards, now did you?  I repaid your favor.  Now leave me be!

text=Led by Edwin VanCleef, the Stonemason's Guild was composed of the most skilled builders among men.  The Stonemasons helped to rebuild the broken city of Stormwind that was razed by the orcs during the First War. VanCleef and his tradesmen were peerless builders and their work and artistry was evident in the edifices of the Cathedral of Light and Stormwind Keep itself.

[page 42]
next_page=43
text=However, the nobles of Stormwind ran up a huge debt by expanding the kingdom's military presence through Elwynn and into Stranglethorn. The massive debt crippled the kingdom's economy and stripped VanCleef and his Stonemasons of their promised rewards.  After spending years toiling to rebuild the glorious city, the Stonemasons were left broke, forgotten by the city's corrupt officials.

[page 43]
text=Having personally known Edwin VanCleef my entire life, I can tell you that facing him as a foe is quite a daunting task.  You see, he was my childhood friend, and I personally trained him in the ways of the shadows thinking that one day he might consider a career alongside me.  If VanCleef is heading up the Defias Brotherhood, may the Light have mercy on our souls.

Destroyed houses and farms could be found everywhere, and the cemetary near Raven's Hill now dominated much of the area. A shocked and bewildered Morgan eventually made his way to his home, only to find it in ruins. Not knowing what had befallen his homeland, he

He recognized many names of people that he knew and became more and more distraught. Then he saw them: a small, untended plot amongst the many with three small gravestones. A feeling of dread washed over him as he approached. Morgan brushed off the dust of the most prominent gravestone to reveal the name on it. Simply carved upon the grave, letters spelled out

Then, hours later, something in him snapped, and he began to lash out. He brought his sword out of its scabbard and began to rain blows on the gravestones, screaming in rage. Blind in his fury, he lashed out and swung wildly, catching the notice

Because Morgan committed murder against innocents, something that went completely against his beliefs and his nature, and because of the grief that he held in being unable to save his family, Morgan could not die a peaceful death, and lived on as one of the restless dead.

text=The trolls situated in Dun Morogh are largely centralized in Frostmane Hold, a mountain cave on the western border. They have sufficient numbers to cause some concern, however, they seem more than content to stay in their cave. This is, no doubt, because they do not wish to incur the wrath of the dwarves again, and risk total extermination. Their actions can be considered territorial, if anything, and it is

Ajeck and I gave a casual glance, assuming the man was simply giving Barnil a much-needed scolding for his carelessness.  Erlgadin, however, gestured slowly with his head toward a nearby fallen tree.  Gazing back at us were two piercing black eyes just above a mouthful of razor sharp fangs.

text=The kill brought about a festive mood amongst the expedition.  Barnil poured mead for all to enjoy.  But our festivities were short-lived.  As we were preparing the corpse for transport back to base camp we were all caught off guard by a horrendous growl.  In all my years I have never heard anything so blood curdling.

[page 105]
text=On a rocky precipice above, silhouetted by the setting sun, I could make out the largest cat of prey I have ever laid eyes upon.  I was able to loose one clumsy volley with my rifle, but the cat held his ground.  He growled once again, this time louder than the first, and vanished.
text=
text=We gathered our belongings and headed solemnly back to camp.

[page 108]
text=On this day we ventured to the south, following some fresh panther tracks.  Soon we reached a ravine spanned by a tremendous rope bridge.  I could not help but to think of Brann's descriptive writings of this region when I saw the engineering marvel.  So often it was assumed that the native Trolls were a primitive and uneducated race yet as I gazed upon the master craftsmanship of the bridge I was able to recognize the skill with which the Troll builders overcame the seemingly impossible feat.

[page 110]
text=Both Ajeck and Sir Erlgadin stood poised, guns leveled at the bristling overgrowth at the base of the swaying trees.  The midday sun beat heavily upon us.  A slow trickle of perspiration trailed down from Elrgadin's temple as he pulled the pin back.  Upon the sound of the click, the thick flora parted and a large black panther -- a beautiful specimen -- darted out onto the plain.
text=

[page 112]
text=His gun tossed back violently in his arms.  The barrel swooped sideways and came up beneath Ajeck's rifle.  Ajeck had chosen that exact moment to pull her trigger.  The rifle, the aim now knocked clumsily toward the tree line, went off with a distinct boom.  A flock of birds screamed out of the canopy, scattering in every direction.  A plume of smoke rose from the tree.  We watched in awe as a tremendous branch fell squarely on the fleeing panther, breaking its back.
text=

[page 114]
text=We set out at first light, heading south past the Tkashi Ruins.  Barnil voiced concern that we might encounter members of the Bloodscalp Tribe.  I reminded Barnil that the Bloodscalps were more concerned with destroying their tribal enemy, the Skullsplitters.  Needless to say, Barnil was not comforted in the least.  I, however, had a loaded rifle, a satchel full of gunpowder and three deadly hunters with me to ease any concerns of an unfriendly ambush.
text=

[page 115]
text=I've stood before a towering Infernal on the battlefield, the army of the Burning Legion advancing from all directions.  An unruly band of Trolls seems as harmless as a jackrabbit in the hills of Dun Morogh.
text=
text=We passed the Tkashi Ruins without event, much to Barnil's relief.  The party proceeded to head westward, toward the Great Sea, skirting the Ruins of Zul'Kunda just to the south.  As we ascended the high sea bluffs we spotted our first Raptor.

[page 118]
text=Our hastily aimed shots were enough to buy Barnil's escape.  Barnil clamored back down the hill and rejoined the party. We scurried off into the jungle; a pack of ferocious Lashtail Raptor's stalking our every move.
text=
text=The hunters were now the hunted.

[page 119]
text=I led the party toward the sea, hoping the shoreline would provide refuge from the Raptors.  In our haste we had drifted too far north, to a precariously high elevation.  The mistake was made.  The fault was mine.  We stopped just short of a sheer cliff, the Raptors just a few paces behind.
text=

[page 120]
text=I stepped slowly forward, gun raised.  I had led these brave hunters to their death.  I would die defending them.  Lashtail Raptors are particularly fierce, known for their unrelenting blood-thirst.  They far outnumbered us.  But I would be damned if I let them kill me and my comrades without shedding some of their own blood first.
text=

[page 121]
text=Ajeck and Sir Erlgadin readied their weapons, flanking me on either side, our backs to the sea.  Barnil let out a defeated sigh and drew his axe.  The Lashtails were almost upon us.  Their steady stride had slowed.  They were stalking their prey now for they knew they had us trapped.

[page 153]
next_page=154
text=Our first day went as well as one can expect first days to go.  Most of our time was preoccupied with making the necessary arrangements to establish a base camp.  I located an ideal setting by a freshwater river inlet.  Judging by the old, abandoned docks nearby, this site was inhabited sometime ago.  As for the original inhabitants, only time can tell that tale.

next_page=155
text=For this expedition I have assembled Ajeck Rouack and Sir S. J Erlgadin, along with my trusted servant, Barnil Stonepot.  I fought alongside Ajeck's father's side in many battles in defense of the Alliance.  Seeing her grown is quite special.  Her father schooled her well in the ways of weaponry.  Her skills with a bow make me wonder if there is elven blood running through those veins.
text=

[page 155]
next_page=156
text=Sir S. J. Erlgadin comes from human aristocracy.  His father, Count Erlgadin, was renowned for his generosity.  It was the Count who lobbied for improved working conditions for the Stonemasons' Guild during the restoration of Stormwind after the Second Great War.
text=

[page 156]
next_page=157
text=In the years that followed, after Stormwind betrayed the Stonemasons' Guild, Sir Erlgadin grew bitter about the role of the nobles within the Kingdom.  He no longer wished to uphold the position that his father's bloodline had earned for him in the House of Nobles.  But I digress.  The purpose of this story is not to act as a political treatise or a biography.  This is the account of my experiences hunting big game in the green hills of Stranglethorn?….

[page 157]
next_page=158
text=We rose with the sun.  Barnil began to prepare the morning meal. I noticed Ajeck's attention was somewhat distracted.  The day's trek would be long and our hunt would bring us close to danger.  A lack of focus could easily lead to an errant mishap.  Yet Ajeck seemed unable to divert her gaze from Barnil who stood by the edge of the river rinsing out his mess kit.
text=

[page 158]
next_page=159
text=Just as I was about to question Ajeck's lack of interest in the day's hunting strategy, she reached for her quiver, drew an arrow and unleashed a shot right towards poor Barnil.  But it was not Barnil that Ajeck was shooting at.  For when Barnil stepped aside, mouth agape, a large river crocilisk floated to the surface with Ajeck's arrow perfectly placed between his two large eyes.
text=

[page 159]
next_page=160
text=We set out toward the west, through the thick overgrowth of the tangled jungle.  Moving with slow, deliberate steps we paced through thick foliage in search of prey.  The morning passed in frustrated silence.  Nothing was stirring in the Vale, not even a breeze.  By the afternoon, the expedition had grown restless Barnil no longer strode with the cautious steps of a predator tracking prey.  Rather he clumsily clomped along the path often stepping noisily on dried leaves or fallen branches.
text=

[page 160]
text=During one such misstep, Erlgadin laid a heavy hand on Barnil's shoulder.  Ajeck and I gave a casual glance, assuming the man was simply giving Barnil a much-needed scolding for his carelessness.  Erlgadin, however, gestured slowly with his head toward a nearby fallen tree.  Gazing back at us were two piercing black eyes just above a mouthful of razor sharp fangs.
text=

[page 169]
next_page=170
text=The Humans trained their sites on the panther as it ran along the edge of the tree line.  The barrels of their guns moved in perfect parallel tandem.  Barnil gave me an urging glance but I shook my head no.  This hunt was for the Humans, not Barnil or me.  Erlgadin fired a booming shot, missing the panther altogether.  Apparently he was unprepared for the violent kickback of the rifle blast.

[page 170]

text=As the weeks passed our stockpile of panther and tiger skins grew immense.  I decided it was time for the expedition to shift our focus to a new challenge: Raptors.
text=
text=The Humans, while appreciative of the training Barnil and I offered, decided to refrain from hunting with firearms.  Ajeck was much more comfortable with a finely strung bow and Sir Erlgadin never left camp without his sturdy crossbow.

[page 174]
next_page=175
text=The beast never so much as detected our presence.  In fact, the only greeting he received from the expedition was a bullet between the eyes.  Sir Erlgadin let out a hearty *hurrah* as Ajeck nodded toward me with keen approval.  I sifted through my pack in search of my pipe, hoping to enjoy a celebratory smoke.  Barnil began to scurry up the hillside to retrieve the Raptor's corpse.  I stared at the fallen beast with the satisfaction that accompanies every big kill.
text=

[page 175]
next_page=176
text=But I could not bask in the glory of the kill for long.  For when I turned my eyes toward the horizon, several silhouettes appeared cresting the hill, just above poor Barnil.
text=
text=*Flee, Barnil!* I shouted.  Ajeck, Sir Erlgadin and myself loosed a volley of bullets, arrows and bolts over Barnil and toward the pursuing raptors.  One of us landed a kill amidst the confusion.
text=

[page 176]
text=Our hastily aimed shots were enough to buy Barnil's escape.  Barnil clamored back down the hill and rejoined the party. We scurried off into the jungle; a pack of ferocious Lashtail Raptor's stalking our every move.

text=

[page 180]
next_page=181
text=And then something miraculous happened.  From off to our side we heard the distinct and terrifying roar of the great white tiger.  Despite their numbers, the Raptors turned and scattered in all directions.  We saw but a brief white flash as the tiger darted past us and pounced on one of the Raptors.  No command needed to be given.  All four members of our party knew it was time to run.
text=

[page 181]
text=We sprinted all the way back to base camp, never slowing.  Later that night we sat quietly around the campfire, knowing our lives had been saved by a bizarre twist of fate.  Such are the risks of the big game hunter.  We toy with fate by delivering it.  Yet each of us, at some point, will face fate's razor sharp teeth.  This Dwarf is just glad that moment did not come upon the green hills of Stranglethorn.

text=The site's excavation continues, but it is slowed by the Troggs mentioned in my last report.  I am confident they can be dealt with, even if some of these Troggs are more aggressive than usual.
text=
text=More artifacts were found recently, though in all cases but one (which I will discuss below), recent findings are of the same caliber as before - interesting, if not enlightening.
text=

[page 183]
next_page=184
text=There has been one exception.  The peculiarly carved idols found recently (a brief description of these was included in my last report) seem to have an effect on the Troggs at the site.  They are drawn to the stone carvings, and some Troggs are driven berserk by them!
text=
text=More study is required for any conclusions regarding these idols, but I remain hopeful that they will shed light on a link between the Troggs and the Titans.
text=

next_page=187
text=It began with the finding of that cursed scythe in the mine they call Roland's Doom.  Yes, that was the start of it.  Before that, the Defias Brotherhood was happy with our progress in Duskwood.  Before the Scythe, the terrors of this place seemed as tame as Northshire Valley.
text=
text=But ever since I found the haft of the Scythe jutting from that pile of rubble in the mine and, curse me, pulled it free, Roland's Doom became a place of vile death!
text=

[page 187]
next_page=188
text=If I had known what would happen, I would have cut off my own hand to keep from grasping that rune-carved wood.  So many regrets!  I always thought that was a privilege of the old.  I now know that it is not the old - it is the hopeless - who don the mantle of regret, unable and unwilling to shrug it from shoulders stooped with misery.
text=
text=But enough waxing like a pipe-mad poet.  I must continue with the chronicle...
text=

[page 188]
next_page=189
text=After the Scythe was freed, a change rippled through the mine.  Light from our flickering torches warped, and the strength of our voices seemed beyond our control.  Sometimes a man's whisper roared through the tunnels forcing hands on ears, and sometimes our shouts barely traveled a few steps before diminishing into a hint on the wind.
text=
text=Unnerving, yes, but we did not have long to wonder at this strangeness.  It was but a harbinger of what truly drove us from the mine.  The Worgen.
text=

[page 189]
next_page=190
text=They came at us from everywhere, clawing from hidden holes at our feet and dropping upon us from silent perches above.  Half our men fell in those first panicked minutes.  The rest, including myself, tried to flee.  As I ran I saw so many of my brothers taken by tooth and claw, heard so many screams cut short or gurgle to silence.
text=
text=For all I know, I am the only human to escape that place.
text=

[page 190]
next_page=191
text=I can only guess why I survived that night.  I have always been cautious, always quick to flinch from jabs and leap free of pitfalls.  My nickname, Jitters, comes from this trait.  So perhaps it was just that knack for caution that saved me...
text=
text=Or maybe it was the Scythe I pulled from the rubble.  It cannot be the Scythe itself, for I lost it during my frantic flight.  But if it was I who brought the Worgen to Duskwood, then perhaps the Worgen afforded me a rare courtesy.  Curse them.
text=

[page 191]
next_page=192
text=Or perhaps, I am doomed to witness the change I wrought on Duskwood.  Perhaps it is my fate to watch as the Worgen tear into this land, staining it ever darker with their foulness.
text=
text=If that truly is my fate, then it is twofold.  For the Worgen are not the only power to clutch at Duskwood - the fiends from Deadwind Pass have also staked claim.
text=
text=That is the next chapter of my tale, and I pray it is the last...
text=

[page 192]
next_page=193
text=After surviving the flight from Roland's Doom, I hid within a barn owned by a man named Sven.  I spent a few days in the barn, and such horror lingered with me that I never once made myself known to Sven or his family.  But from what I saw from my hiding place, I knew these farmers were quite decent folk.  Had I stepped from my concealment I think they would have taken me in, but trust is hard for me.  Harder still after that shock in the mine.
text=
text=So I remained hidden.  And it saved my life.
text=

[page 193]
next_page=194
text=A few days after I arrived at the barn, Sven left his farm for Darkshire.  He kissed his wife and smiled to his children and promised to return soon with toys and sweets.  The poor man.  That was the last time he saw his family unmutilated.
text=
text=At least they parted happily.  And at least his wife was the first to die, and was freed from seeing the slaughter of her children.  But these small graces do nothing for me.  I saw what happened, and it will ever haunt my dreams.
text=

[page 194]
next_page=195
text=My hand trembles as I recall the details of that night, when Sven was away and his family was doomed to face the Black Riders alone.  Again regret claws at me, for I was there and could have risen against those fiends from Deadwind Pass.  But it is a false regret.  It is the same that plagues any survivor of a tragedy.  I know that, had I left my place of hiding I too would have been killed, my body ripped and torn, and its pieces spread so widely that I would not be recognized.
text=

[page 195]
next_page=196
text=But, even though I know I could have done nothing to stop this heinous murder, one true regret does remain: I brought the Black Riders to Sven's farm.  My discovery of the Scythe not only unleashed the Worgen upon Duskwood - it drew the Riders from Deadwind Pass.
text=
text=I know this because, just before they began their slaughter they asked one question to Sven's wife as she held her children close, giving them what comfort she could though she was certain death was near.
text=

[page 196]
next_page=197
text="The Scythe of Elune." one of the Riders shrieked in a voice both harsh and shrill, like the grinding of an axe on stone.  And the last word - Elune - it croaked, as if choking on the sound.
text=
text=Dread gripped me when I heard that voice, both from the horrid sound of it, and because...I knew the Scythe of which the Rider spoke.  It must be the same cursed thing I drew from the rocks of Roland's Doom days before.  It was what the Black Riders sought!
text=
text=And it was what would kill Sven's family.
text=

[page 197]
next_page=198
text=I never learned the name of Sven's wife, as she was only ever called "dearest," and "my love," and "mommy" by her husband and children.  But I wish I knew it.  I am the only living memory of her deed that day, and although she was just a farmer's wife, never have I seen a man or woman act with such bravery.
text=
text=Of course she did not know of the Scythe, but when she learned the Riders sought it, in an instant a plan formed in her head.
text=
text=And it was bold and clever.  If only it had worked.
text=

[page 198]
next_page=199
text="The Scythe?" she said in a calm voice.  "Of course I do.  Who here wouldn't?"  She looked at the Riders with steady eyes, and I would have sworn she spoke the truth if I had not known better. There was no way she could know about the Scythe.
text=
text=Her gambit paid off.  The same Rider who uttered the question before bent his head slightly toward her, and shrieked, "Where?"
text=
text="I'll take you.  All of you," she said, and I could see a small hope flicker behind her eyes.
text=

[page 199]
next_page=200
text="But the way is far, and my children would slow us.  We must leave them."
text=
text=Her trick was simple, but simple tricks have the best hope of success.  If it worked, it would lead the Riders away from the farm.  She would be lost, but her children would be safe.  And it would work, if only the Riders believed her noble lies.
text=
text=Although I have never been a student of the Light, I prayed fiercely for Sven's wife as she stood against those terrible Riders.
text=
text="Please," I prayed.  "Let them believe."
text=

[page 200]
next_page=201
text=They stood, frozen, and she met their gazes with calm.  Then one rider looked up, as if hearing a distant call.  He drew from his garb a small gem and peered into it.  He then gestured with the bauble toward Sven's wife.  A light crept from the Rider toward the woman, shaping itself into a grim, white hand.  She stared into the light, unflinching, but I could see uncertainty behind her mask of confidence.  When the hand reached her, it spread its fingers over her head.
text=
text=And it squeezed.

[page 201]
next_page=202
text=Sven's wife stood rigid as a board, and her eyes grew wide.  And although her lips pulled back to mouth a scream, no sound escaped.  After a few moments of this torture the hand released her, dropping her to her knees.  The Rider who held the bauble then sat erect in his saddle, and a loud voice erupted from it.
text=
text="This woman lies," it said in a voice that has scarred my dreams.  "She has not seen the Scythe."

[page 202]
next_page=203
text=After this, the Rider's shoulders stooped slightly, as if a spirit within him had fled.  And then in the old, shrieking voice it used earlier, these final words were uttered:
text=
text="The Lord has spoken.  Kill them."

[page 203]
next_page=246
text=I cannot describe what happened next.  It is clear in my mind, but even my wretched soul cannot put to paper the events of those next few, grisly minutes.
text=
text=I can only write that Sven's family was killed.  And soon after, Sven returned to this grim, deathly scene.  Such grief was in him that I was afraid to show myself.  And so afraid was I that he would find me, I fled from my hiding spot in the barn.  I do not know where Sven is now, but I pray he will, some day, find peace.

text=Your Majesty,
text=
text=There are many reasons as to why I felt that a report should be compiled and presented on the recent affairs of the "Defias Brotherhood" and their activities throughout the kingdom.
text=
text=For perspective, I shall begin with a bit of history. As you may or may not know, my service to the city of Stormwind began as a member of the Stonemasons' Guild. Through years of work, we completed the rebuilding of

[page 220]
next_page=221
text=Stormwind, at which time the Stonemasons' Guild bills and fees and salaries left unpaid and unspoken for.
text=
text=At that time, Edwin VanCleef had been elected Guildmaster of the Stonemasons, and spoke out, demanding restitution for our works. In response, the Stormwind House of Nobles ordered the Stonemasons' Guild disbanded, which, understandably, angered VanCleef. Leading a riot, VanCleef led the Stonemasons out of the city.
text=
text=Before I continue, there are some other events that took place during

[page 221]
next_page=222
text=this time that I should bring to your attention.
text=

text=Through study of various fossilized creatures I have deduced that in ancient times, a great plague swept through the waters of Lake Lordamere.  What caused this?  We might never know.  But the rate of contamination appears to be extremely high based on dense concentrations of remains distributed across the lake bed.

[page 237]
next_page=238
text=In an attempt to uncover the past, I have begun to examine the creatures of the present in hopes of finding the missing clue to this mystery.  The Lake Skulkers and Lake Creepers are ancient beasts who inhabit the islands in the center of Lake Lordamere.  There is a moss which grows on them that resembles trace materials on some of the fossils.  More research needs to be done before I can speculate as to what this connection means.

[page 238]
text=While trying to collect moss samples I came across the scene of a bloody battle.  The Vile Fin tribe of Murlocs had come under siege by a marauding band of Gnolls.  There were both Gnoll and Murloc corpses littering the battlefield.  As I passed a mangled Murloc body I noticed a strange hardened tumor protruding from the wound.  As I began to study the tumor it became clear it held similar properties to the moss I was collecting.  Unfortunately, I could find no other tumors besides the one.

text=
text=If you receive this letter, Yvette, then know that Devlin is a traitor.

[page 253]
next_page=254
text=Devlin despaired and sought an escape from our ill fortunes, and in doing so he made a pact with the Scourge.  I do not know what price was promised him for his betrayal, but I'm sure it was laced with lies.
text=
text=If you see my brother, then flee from him.  He is a fiend.  A few nights ago he murdered two of our watchmen and let a small group of Scourge through the breach, leading them to where many more of us slept.

[page 254]
next_page=255
text=Their ambush was brutal.  They slew a third of us before we could take them down.  Now, we barely have enough men to watch our borders.  It is only a matter of time before our wearying guard drops and the Scourge attack.
text=
text=And although I saw Devlin's face amidst the desperate men and gaunt-faced Scourge on that cursed night, he slipped away before I could catch him.  He might be dead, or he might still live as an agent of the Scourge.
text=
text=Either way, he is a monster.

[page 255]
next_page=256
text=Devlin warned us that if we tried to face the Scourge, then we were doomed.  He told us this when they first entered Tirisfal Glades, well before they encircled our home.  Perhaps he was pleading with us to leave, or perhaps he was gloating.

text=It was always hard to understand Devlin's motives.  Since he was a child, he was a mystery to us.

text=Kegan Darkmar, leader of the small group of undead who came to us in search of asylum from their "brethren," defies our common attitudes toward his kind.  His skin may be rotting and blood may have long stopped flowing through his veins, but he acts very nobly and seems to care more for his compatriots' safety than his own.
text=
text=Indeed, there is a humanity within him that, I confess, I sometimes see lacking in the humans around me.

[page 267]
next_page=268
text=But why do I mention this?  I do so to give credence to what I am about to write, for these words came from Kegan's lips and it is my hope that my colleagues will, upon reading this journal, know why I believe what he said:
text=
text="Remnants of the Old Gods still linger in the deep hollows of the world.  New forces seek to harness that ancient power, and those who succeed will have a terrible weapon against their enemies."

[page 268]
next_page=269
text=That is what Kegan uttered as he handed his bloodstone pendant to me, and there was fear, and maybe reverence, in his eyes as he did so.  And as his hands met with mine they lingered, as if reluctant to give up the pendant.  Revulsion swept through me, yet to this day I know not if I reviled against his dead flesh pressed to mine, or if the pendant itself made my skin crawl.
text=
text=For I felt a power within it.  A deep, hidden, hungry power.  And one yearning for release.

[page 269]
next_page=270
text=Although my colleagues in Dalaran were cautious to study the bloodstones that Kegan and his followers brought with them, instead quarantining the four refugees and leaving the bloodstones on their persons, the sincerity of Kegan obliged me to study his bloodstone pendant.

[page 270]
next_page=271
text=My hopes were to verify for my colleagues that this type of stone did possess magical properties, and if we wizards of Dalaran did not wish to exploit the power of bloodstones, we should at the least learn their properties, since our foes may one day use them against us.
text=
text=And so my studies began.

[page 271]
next_page=272
text=I started my tests with the assumption that bloodstone was a type of rock, like quartz or obsidian.  So I began a series of procedures to determine: what minerals were contained within bloodstone, what forces were applied to produce its color and hardness, and other properties common to rocks and ore.  But the bloodstone pendant, to my frustration, did not react to my procedures as would normal ore.

[page 272]
next_page=273
text=In fact, it often acted in precisely the opposite fashion as expected!  It was almost as if the pendant was deliberately fouling my experiments.
text=
text=Like it was thinking, and alive.
text=
text=Angered but not discouraged, I switched from assuming the pendant was an inert piece of rock, to assuming it was a living thing.
text=
text=But again, I failed.

[page 273]
next_page=274
text=None of my new tests brought to light any revelations of the origin of bloodstone.  At the time the only riddle I solved was that bloodstone was neither living, nor dead!
text=
text=But it was then, at the brink of failure, that a breakthrough was made.  My latest test involved a glass beaker whose brim was chipped, leaving a small, jagged space along its edge.  When the test was over, again revealing nothing, I went to clean my worktable and cut myself on the beaker.

[page 274]
next_page=275
text=The cut was not deep but nevertheless bled fiercely.  Before I could wrap my injured finger in a bandage, a good deal of my blood had spilled on my worktable.
text=
text=And as I was cleaning up this new mess, I noticed the strangest thing...

[page 275]
next_page=276
text=The blood that had spilled near the bloodstone pendant was slowly moving toward the piece of jewelry, as if gravity had somehow bent itself toward the bloodstone.  The blood that touched the pendant seemed to disappear, and the red color of the stone deepened as it drank more of my blood.

[page 276]
next_page=277
text=After seeing this my head grew light, perhaps from my recent injury (though I did not believe I had lost that much blood) or perhaps because I had finally, after so much frustration, uncovered one of the bloodstone's properties.  I reached behind me for my work stool and sat down, pondering.  Thoughts and questions raced through my head, dizzying and threatening to topple me.
text=
text=Does bloodstone drink blood?  Does it crave blood?  Does it attract blood?

[page 277]
next_page=278
text=Or, is bloodstone made of blood?  And if so, then whose blood?  Mine?  The blood of any human?  Any animal?
text=
text=Or maybe bloodstone is the blood of some unknown thing, the very thing that Kegan had both feared and revered when he handed me his pendant.
text=
text=That is the question that must be answered.  It is the key.

[page 278]
next_page=279
text=Fire rekindled within me, I then dove back into my experiments.  This time I made no assumptions, methodically performing every test at my disposal.  This increased my required efforts tremendously, but I would be more likely to make discoveries.
text=
text=And, although my lab here is small and I have no subordinates to spare to aid, I did find one more intriguing quality of bloodstone...

[page 279]
next_page=280
text=In addition to blood, there are elemental forces fused within the stone.  Fire, water, thunder and rock are mixed with the blood (but again, the blood of what?), and although this mixture is outwardly inert, all these forces seem to rage inwardly against each other.  So many more questions were then raised about this amazing, and foreboding material.

[page 280]
next_page=281
text=But to answer those questions, more studies and experiments must be performed on the pendant, and I fear that the Lordamere Interment Camp cannot marshal the manpower nor the equipment for the task.  So I sent the bloodstone pendant with a courier to Dalaran with specific instructions on how to test it, so they may avoid my earlier frustrations.

[page 281]
next_page=282
text=As I waited for the results of these tests, I spent my time speaking to Kegan.  Although I constantly pressed him for what he knew about bloodstones, he never told me more than what he said the day he gave me his pendant.  And he did not often speak of his time within the fold of what he called "the Forsaken," which is the name he calls his clan of undead.

[page 282]
next_page=283
text=But Kegan was very eager to speak on other subjects, particularly his time growing up in Lordaeron before its fall.
text=
text=He still holds much love for that lost kingdom, even though it is now ruined, and dead.
text=
text=My growing fondness for Kegan gave me patience as I waited for my test results.

[page 283]
next_page=284
text=But after weeks of no news my patience faltered, and upon further inquires to Dalaran I learned that the bloodstone never reached my colleagues.  My courier was somehow lost on the way, and the bloodstone pendant was lost with him!
text=
text=This is grave news, for although Kegan and his followers still have bloodstone specimens with which we may experiment, I fear the pendant my fall into unsavory hands.

[page 284]
text=I have sent another messenger to Dalaran, and hear that even now they are scouring for the pendant, in the ruins outside our protective sphere.

While troll species have been encountered along the length and breadth of Azeroth, Khaz Modan and Lordaeron, little evidence of their civilization has been found in the newly discovered lands of Kalimdor or upon the islands in the South Seas. Whether this demonstrates an unwillingness of

text=For years, the Tidebearer served the Gurubashi Empire, summoning his thrall water elementals in battle and manipulating the flow of water in Stranglethorn Vale for the benefit of the Empire. But as the years went on, the Tidebearer became more reclusive, tending to stay for long periods of time away from court.
text=
text=The Tidebearer was hiding a secret from the prying eyes of court. The abilities granted to him by the Stone of the Tides also came with a curse. As the years

With each coming and going of the tides, the Tidebearer became less of himself, losing his corporeal form--pulsing in and out of existence--until in his dying days, he traveled to the beach where he had first found the Stone, and walked into the sea, disappearing for the last time.
text=
text=Generations later, the Stone of the Tides washed upon the shores of Stranglethorn, and another Tidebearer was chosen, as the troll brought the Stone to

text=Where once I thought it preposterous that a human would come to our lands and learn our ways, this wizard, this evil man, came here and not only survived, but also gained some of our knowledge. I'm still uncertain how...
text=
text=I never discovered his goals during my investigation, but his plan seemed simple: using druidic magic, he wanted to befriend and then control the furbolg. If it was in an attempt to harm my kin, or for some other malicious purpose, I hope to find out before my path ends.

[page 405]
next_page=406
text=Regardless, he was apparently more successful than naught in actualizing his plans. Did he want to attempt his machinations on the furbolg before trying on my people? Did the furbolg have something he coveted? Who knows?
text=
text=Using an item he created (a rod or staff of some kind), he attempted to infiltrate the furbolg tribes of Ashenvale. At some point, and this is where many of the details are still unclear, he was discovered by the furbolg while trying to manipulate them into acting against

[page 406]
next_page=407
text=one another. As I'm sure the elves would be, the furbolg were angered, but they reacted much more strongly and killed Dartol.
text=
text=The furbolg, at least at this time, weren't the same corrupted creatures they've become. They were still rational and intelligent--their relationship with our people amicable.
text=
text=I'm hoping that if I can recreate the rod with the help of a dryad named Shael'dryn, I can use its power to help our people... and the furbolg.

[page 407]
next_page=408
text=Not all the furbolg have been corrupted. Some still live and try to protect the forest. During their corruption, some of the furbolg fled, many were killed, and others were forced out of their tribes.
text=
text=I found a venerable furbolg of the Foulweald tribe living above Lake Mystral--his name is Krolg.
text=
text=I've watched him for days, and I think if I were to approach him in the guise of a furbolg, I could help him and discover a way to re-establish a bond between our people.

text=Along with killing Dartol, the furbolg split up the rod into three parts so it couldn't be used against them again. It has been difficult, but I've a good idea where all three parts were placed.
text=
text=The Gem
text=The first part of the rod, a glowing gem, was hidden in a shrine in Northwestern Ashenvale. I believe now this shrine is the ruins at the center of Lake Falathim. The Sentinels tell me that it's been inhabited by murlocs now.

text=My research tells me that the guardians kept the piece in a small glade locked within a chest. To find out any more, I'll have to speak to Shael'dryn.

text=Shael'dryn is a dryad who protects the moonwell northeast of Lake Iris. She refuses to leave the forest or forsake it to the corruption. I know she has the power and knowledge to repair the rod, or to at least tell me how I can do it on my own.

text=The pommel
text=The pommel of the rod was given to the druids of Dor'danil. There is one major problem with this though: the druids are dead.
text=
text=Their spirits now inhabit the area and are no longer hospitable.

[page 412]
next_page=413
text=This may require more investigation. I'm not sure I'm powerful enough to fight the spirits of my dead kin...let alone delve into the depths of Dor'danil and find the pommel.
text=
text=(Note: During my preparations in Astranaar, I've recently met a dwarf hunter who has spent a good portion of his time in Ashenvale trying to help my people. He came from a place called Stormwind.
text=
text=We spoke over a few ales one night, and his tales have given me new hope of finding the pommel...

[page 413]
next_page=414
text=He tells me he's been throughout all of Dor'danil, and he's never seen a chest or any container that may hold the pommel.
text=
text=He also tells me that rotting slimes have inhabited the area, and they devour almost anything smaller than them. He's seen them "eat" tables, sculptures, bears, and even gnomes!
text=
text=The slimes seem to gain a great deal of sustenance from things magical. If the chest holding the pommel was enchanted at all, the slimes might have eaten it.

[page 414]
text=It's a gamble, but I have no other clues at this time...
text=
text=As I find out more I'll put the details here; but until then, I shall work on finding the parts of the rod and helping Ashenvale.

[page 415]
text=Jin'Zil,
text=   It has been a while, but I thought you would like to know that the last of the Bloodfeather's have been slain. Don't thank me though, the person delivering the letter is the slayer. If you'd like, I can have her head delivered to you after the caravan makes its rounds through the Barrens. I know you like that sort of stuff for your voodoo magics.

text=Okay, you should have your NG-5 charges and detonators ready. I've labeled them for you... Blue is for the lumber mill. Red is for Windshear Mine.
text=
text=I did some scouting, and there are enough explosives throughout Windshear Crag that it shouldn't be a problem at all for you to get in, plant the explosives, and then get out before detonating them.
text=
text=Remember, this is a distraction. Get far from the wagons before the goblins get there to check out what happened, then sneak in behind them.

[page 418]
next_page=419
text=Be careful with them by the way. The Nitromirglyceronium alone could reduce you to dust. I've encased some of the liquid in copper tubes which should keep it stable and safe.
text=
text=The scroll you got from Collin I used on the detonator boxes. They will now send a silent message to the NG-5 charges after you've set them. I used a simple Stalthwargon mechanism to make sure the wire conductivity is optimal and the flow of the Nitroglyceronium between the differential fluid is better than average.

[page 419]
next_page=420
text=Before I get back into the details about my design, let me explain where you should place the explosives.
text=
text=Plan Alpha- the lumber mill:
text=There's a wagon out in front of the lumber mill (this is northeast of their deforestation and lumber collection construct). I suspect the engineering plans are inside of the lumber mill.
text=
text=To plant the charge, head to the back of the wagon. Once it's set, make haste and get some distance.

[page 420]
next_page=421
text=When you're ready, hit the detonator.
text=
text=I've ensured a strong signal by routing copper and silver wires with a Melthusian antenae array within the casing of the box. That should give you good range. Just be careful of the goblins nearby. They won't appreciate my creation if they catch you in their site.
text=
text=Oh, just in case it wasn't obvious, don't be near the wagon when it blows... it'll hurt.

[page 421]
next_page=422
text=Plan Beta- Windshear Mine:
text=
text=I saw the goblins using another wagon of explosives north of the mine's entrance. I think that should be a good enough place to plant NG-5 Charge (Red). After you set the charge in the back of the wagon, get some distance and hit the button.
text=
text=If the goblins don't come running to check out the commotion, it's probably because the mountain came down on top of their heads.

[page 422]
text=The Venture Co. Letters are outside the mine... I think on some crates on the bottom level.
text=
text=Good luck, and remember...
text=
text=Blue Charge: lumber mill
text=Red Charge: mine
text=
text=Oh, and destroy this letter after you've accomplished your mission. Hmm, maybe I should look into a way to make these things destroy themselves after they're read. That's not a bad idea...

text=My journey from Ironforge finally brings me to Kalimdor!
text=
text=Prospector Khazgorm of Bael Modan is making great headway. He uncovered a fossil today which the site scholars believe to be a bone fragment of an ancient god. Khazgorm is certain the fossil is part of a greater mystery. While he oversees the excavation site, he has made it my quest to discover more fossils to piece together the story.
text=
text=My assignment: head to the south in search of more clues.

text=--Day Two--
text=
text=The lands of the Barrens are vast and expansive. My trek has been long and arduous and has yielded nothing of interest for the Explorers' League archives so far.
text=
text=The only incident of note took place near the gold road. Off in the distance I noticed some strange creatures. Half pig, half man it seemed. I quickly hid and let the foul beasts pass. My what a foul stench they left behind!

[page 426]
next_page=427
text=--Day Three--
text=
text=Oh great and splendid discovery!
text=
text=Whilst exploring today I came across a grand find: massive remains of what seems to have been a boar-like creature. Its skull towered many lengths above me. Each tooth of the beast could dwarf even... well a dwarf. Due to the sheer size of the find, I am lead to believe these are the remains of one of the rumored Old Gods.

[page 427]
next_page=428
text=A while back, at the Explorers' League headquarters in Ironforge, I remember a lecture given by Chief Archeologist Greywhisker. The old chap made mention of such a god, one which was revered by the strange elves of Darnassus because of his rumored altruistic nature--
text=
text=Bah! One moment. I hear snorting outside the tent. Surely just some thistle boars trying to get at my apple stash....

[page 428]
next_page=429
text=--Day 4--
text=
text=Captured!
text=
text=Must... write... quickly.
text=
text=Attacked by boar men of the Razorfen tribe. Believed they were taking me to the great boar remains of the fallen god. Instead, they skirted the great fossils and headed directly west of the giant skull, across the Gold Road.

[page 429]
next_page=430
text=Roughly dragged inside of a foul-smelling, thorn infested bramble called Razorfen Kraul. Thrown inside a crudely crafted hut and held captive along with a dying night elf.
text=
text=No possessions on me save for this journal, my quill and my pocket watch...
text=
text=Someone coming now...

[page 430]
next_page=431
text=--Day 5--
text=
text=My night elf cell mate suffers from grave wounds. The boar men have whipped him repeatedly and I believe he will perish before long unless by some miracle a rescue party braves this treacherous place. He slips in and out of consciousness. When he awakes, I try to give him what little water I have.

[page 431]
next_page=432
text=Last night he was able to speak for the first time. He is a druid, called Heralath, sent to these parts to examine the rumors of the fallen boar god.
text=
text=In a weakened voice he told me that he believed the great boar skull to be the place where the great boar god Agamaggan fell battling the Burning Legion some 10,000 years ago during the War of the Ancients. His massive body flattened the land and his blood sank into the earth. Twisted spires of thorns grow where his blood fell...

[page 432]
next_page=433
text=Heralath and his people seek to discover the source of corruption at this site. Agamaggan was believed to be a pure god, he told me. Why these foul creatures and malignant thorns scar the land is a mystery indeed.
text=
text=Before I could press for more information, Heralath slipped into fitful sleep once again...

[page 433]
next_page=434
text=--Day 6--
text=
text=Heralath's condition worsens.
text=
text=His eyes opened only once today. He spoke with pained anguish but his message was clear. If I were to escape my doom here in Razorfen Kraul, word must be gotten to Falfindel Waywarder in Thalanaar that Charlga Razorflank was rousing minions in the southern Barrens. The power grows with each day. The Crone must be stopped before the plague of corruption can spread from the Kraul.

[page 434]
next_page=435
text=Poor Heralath looks pale as bone. His fever grows worse by the minute. All the while the boar men are preparing for some great military action. I fear that if I do not attempt my escape soon, I will meet a fate similar to my elven cell mate.
text=
text=My plan is to sneak out when the boar men leave for their next hunt. My guards are lazy and often sleep through their shifts.

[page 435]
text=Once free from the Kraul, I will head towards Thousand Needles and then west to Thalanaar on the border of the mysterious forest of Feralas. There I will seek the druid known as Falfindel Waywarder.

text=It never ceases to amaze me how easily hatred can be used to bend people to your will. The orcs and trolls were easiest, their hatred of the Alliance making them willing subjects to hear the message of the Dark Strand. Do they have any inkling of the greater power they serve?

text=The rocket cars that race the flats are higly tuned and require extreme maintenance.  So it's no surprise that pit crews are kept on the scene at all times.
text=
text=These crews constantly test their cars and make fixes and modifications as needed.  It is the only way to keep the cars in a state of top performance.
text=
text=So... we're looking for a means to force a lapse in one of the pit crews' dilligence, as any such lapse would cause the crew's car to fall quickly into disrepair.

[page 446]
text=If we can control which car is in top shape and which car is not, then... I don't need to explain to you the advantage in gambling this gives us.

text=A crisis develops in the Stonetalon Mountains, not far from our Tauren allies' homeland of Mulgore.  The goblin-run Venture company is mining and lumbering fiercely in those moutains, enraging the mountain spirits.

[page 449]
text=I must assume the commotion these spirits cause through channels under the auspice of Tauren shamans and druids distracts them.  For the Tauren consider the Venture Company in the Stonetalon Mountains a dire threat.
text=
text=Threat or not, we must aid our allies.
text=
text=Lydon, you have a broad knowledge of toxins.  Can you devise one that we might use to spread a contagion among the goblins in Stonetalon?

[page 450]
next_page=451
text=Much of the knowledge I have now I could not have possibly learned on my own. Because of this, I am extremely grateful to the night elves. It was only with their help that I have as many details as I do. As a result of our interactions, I am under the impression that their beginnings are much more closely tied to the Aspects than I had first thought. However, they guard their secrets far too closely for even me to know for certain.

[page 451]

text=Alexstrasza:
text=Alexstrasza, the ancient and powerful Queen of the Dragons, was named the Life-Binder by the titans. She was first to be created by the titans to protect the world after they left. It is said that she witnessed the birth of all modern races upon the face of Azeroth. Her red dragonflight, known for their proud demeanor, once ruled over all other dragonkind.

[page 453]

text=Ysera:
text=Ysera the Dreamer represents mortal subconscious. She encompasses the Emerald Dreaming..  While she appreciates imagination and creation and approves of ambition in the mortal races, her and her dragonflight consider the real world to be just an illusion. Ysera is one of the most graceful and powerful creatures any mortal could lay eyes on.

text=Malygos:
text=Malygos is known as the Steward of Magic or the Spell-Weaver. His natural form is not that of a typical dragon, and it is said he can change it at will. Rarely seen after his retreat to the far north, he is almost always in the form of an insect-like creature, but while in dragon form, he and his dragonflight are varying blues in color.

text=Nozdormu:
text=Nozdormu is known as the Master of Time and the Timeless. He and his dragonflight are bronze in color and display great cunning in all things. Nozdormu's attention has always been focused on collecting artifacts of the past, as he cares little for the current matters of the mortal races, or even his fellow Aspects' dealings. His indifference towards the politics of others does not mean he is complacent towards events that transpire throughout the world though.

[page 457]
next_page=458
text=Considered to be protectors, the bronze dragonflight find themselves greatly attracted to areas of civilization. The dragon and his flight are very patient by nature, always relying on observation and acting with a plan before being hasty. Nozdormu will always attempt to protect the time stream and the mortal races when threatened by greater enemies.

[page 458]
next_page=459
text=Neltharion:
text=Neltharion, called the Earth-Warder upon his creation, was more loyal and protective of Azeroth than any of the other Aspects. His black dragonflight were responsible for the creation of the mountains and the other formations of the lands including boundaries between the mortal races. What caused his corruption still remains a mystery; be it an outside influence or something that rotted from within. I wonder if perhaps the Old Gods didn't play a hand in the great black's corruption.

[page 459]
text=The black dragon underwent a complete transformation; and in the end, Neltharion no longer existed. He became Deathwing, a creature of malice and hatred. No longer the Earth-Warder in the eyes of races like the high elves, he was renamed the Death Aspect and Xaxas in place of his titan-given name. Deathwing is the embodiment of chaos and evil, and is always hungry for destruction. He is arguably the first evil of Azeroth that appeared after the banishment of the Old Gods.

text=With Kel'Thuzad's success in Lordaeron, the Lich King made the final preparations for his assault against human civilization. Placing his plague energies into a number of portable artifacts called plague cauldrons, Ner'zhul ordered Kel'Thuzad to transport the cauldrons to Lordaeron where they would be hidden within various cult-controlled villages.

[page 573]
next_page=574
text=The cauldrons, protected by the loyal cultists, would then act as plague generators, sending the plague seeping out across the unsuspecting farmlands and cities of northern Lordaeron.
text=
text=The Lich King's plan worked perfectly. Many of Lordaeron's northern villages were contaminated almost immediately. Just as in Northrend, the citizens who contracted the plague died and arose as the Lich King's willing slaves.

[page 574]
text=The cultists under Kel'Thuzad were eager to die and be raised again in their dark lord's service. They exulted in the prospect of immortality through undeath. As the plague spread, more and more feral zombies arose in the northlands. Kel'Thuzad looked upon the Lich King's growing army and named it the Scourge - for soon, it would march upon the gates of Lordaeron...and scour humanity from the face of the world.

text=No one knows exactly how the universe began. Some theorize that a catastrophic cosmic explosion sent the infinite worlds spinning out into the vastness of the Great Dark - worlds that would one day bear life-forms of wondrous and terrible diversity. Others believe that the universe, as it exists, was created as a whole by a singular, all-powerful entity.

[page 576]

text=Though the exact origins of the chaotic universe remain unclear, it is clear that a race of powerful beings arose to bring order to the various worlds and ensure a safe future for the beings that would follow in their footsteps.
text=

[page 577]
next_page=578
text=They breathed skies and raging atmospheres into being - all part of their unfathomable, far-sighted plan to create order out of chaos. They even empowered primitive races to tend to their works and maintain the integrity of their respective worlds.
text=
text=The Titans, ruled by an elite sect known as the Pantheon, brought order to a hundred million worlds scattered throughout the Great Dark Beyond during the first ages of creation.

[page 578]
text=The benevolent Pantheon, seeking to safeguard their structured worlds, was ever vigilant against the threat of attack from the vile, extra-dimensional entities of the Twisting Nether. The Nether, an ethereal dimension of chaotic magics that connected the myriad worlds of the universe together, was home to an infinite number of malefic, demonic beings, who sought only to destroy life and devour the energies of the living universe.

But we planned for such contingencies. Plan 2 has been set in motion and was well under way before our ambush was set off in Stormwind.

[page 581]
next_page=582
text=Plan 2 is just as simple, but will require more patience on our part. Our man on the inside in Menethil has already been paid for his efforts, and he's succeeded brilliantly. We should have no problem acquiring our target and capturing him once we've set sail.

[page 582]
text=Expect the attack to happen a few miles from their destination. That's where our??? allies??? will be laid in waiting. I'm not sure why we've been forced to form an alliance with the creatures, but I can't help but feel we're being coerced ourselves. Ultimately, it won't matter. With the target in our custody, we'll be well on our way to taking back Stormwind from those that stole it from us!

The bloodthirsty orcs, led by the mighty warchief, Orgrim Doomhammer, not only smashed their way through the dwarf-held lands of Khaz Modan, but had razed many of Lordaeron's central provinces as well.

Under the ragged standards of both Lordaeron and Azeroth, Turalyon's troops slaughtered the bulk of Doomhammer's remaining forces in a glorious, but terrible rout.

[page 631]
next_page=632
text=There was nothing left for the ragged, scattered orc survivors but to flee to the last standing bastion of orcish power - the dark portal.
text=
text=Turalyon and his warriors chased the remaining orcs through the festering Swamp of Sorrows and into the corrupted Blasted Lands where the dark portal stood. There, at the foot of the colossal portal, the broken horde and the rugged Alliance clashed in what would be the last, bloodiest battle of the Second War.

[page 632]
text=Outnumbered and driven mad by the curse of their bloodlust, the orcs inevitably fell before the wrath of the Alliance. Doomhammer was taken prisoner and escorted to Lordaeron while his broken clans were rounded up and hauled north - back to Lordaeron.

[page 633]
next_page=634
text=Only a few months after Nethergarde's completion, the energies of the dark portal coalesced and opened up a new gateway to Draenor. The remaining orc clans, under the leadership of the elder shaman, Ner'zhul, charged forth into Azeroth once again. Intent on stealing a number of magical artifacts that would increase Ner'zhul's power, the orcs planned to open up new portals in Draenor that would allow them to escape their doomed red world forever.

[page 634]
next_page=635
text=Convinced that Ner'zhul was planning a new offensive against the Alliance, King Terenas of Lordaeron sent his armies into Draenor to end the orcish threat once and for all. Led by Khadgar and General Turalyon, the Alliance forces clashed with the orcs across the burning
text=landscape. Even with the aid of the elven Ranger Alleria, the dwarf Kurdran and the veteran soldier Danath, Khadgar was unable to prevent Ner'zhul from opening his portals to other worlds.

[page 635]
next_page=636
text=The tremendous magical storms caused by the portals' converging energies began to tear the ravaged world apart. Ner'zhul, followed only by his most trusted servants, managed to escape through one of the portals as Khadgar fought desperately to return his comrades to Azeroth. Realizing that they would be trapped on the dying world, Khadgar and his companions selflessly decided to destroy the dark portal so that Azeroth would not be harmed by Draenor's violent destruction.

[page 636]
text=By all accounts, the heroes were successful in destroying the portal and saving Azeroth - but whether or not they escaped the death throes of Draenor remains to be seen.

[page 637]
next_page=638
text=Ten thousand years before the orcs and humans clashed in their First War, the world of Azeroth cradled only one massive continent surrounded by the infinite, raging seas. That land mass, known as Kalimdor, was home to a number of disparate races and creatures, all vying for survival amongst the savage elements of the waking world. At the dark continent's center was a mysterious lake of incandescent energies.

[page 638]
next_page=639
text=The lake, which would later be called the Well of Eternity, was the true heart of the world's magic and natural power. Drawing its energies from the infinite Great Dark beyond the world, the Well acted as a mystical fount, sending its potent energies out across the world to nourish life in all its wondrous forms.
text=
text=In time, a primitive tribe of nocturnal humanoids cautiously made their way to the edges of the mesmerizing, enchanted lake.

[page 639]
next_page=640
text=The feral, nomadic humanoids, drawn by the Well's strange energies, built crude homes upon its tranquil shores. Over time, the Well's cosmic power affected the strange tribe, making them strong, wise and virtually immortal. The tribe adopted the name Kaldorei, which meant -children of the stars- in their native tongue. To celebrate their budding society, they constructed great structures and temples around the lake's periphery.

[page 640]
next_page=641
text=The Kaldorei, or night elves as they would later be known, worshipped the moon goddess, Elune, and believed that she slept within the Well's shimmering depths during the daylight hours. The early night elf priests and seers studied the Well with an insatiable curiosity, driven to plumb its untold secrets and power. As their society grew, the night elves explored the
text=breadth of Kalimdor and encountered its myriad denizens.

[page 641]
next_page=642
text=The only creatures that gave them pause were the ancient and powerful dragons. Though
text=the great serpentine beasts were often reclusive, they did much to safeguard the known lands from potential threats. The night elves believed that the dragons held themselves to be the protectors of the world, and that they and their secrets were best left alone.

[page 642]
next_page=643
text=In time, the night elves' curiosity led them to meet and befriend a number of powerful entities, not the least of which was Cenarius, a mighty demi-god of the primordial forestlands. The great-hearted Cenarius grew fond of the inquisitive night elves and spent a great deal of time teaching them about the natural world. The tranquil Kaldorei developed a strong empathy for the living forests of Kalimdor and reveled in the harmonious balance of nature.

[page 643]
next_page=644
text=Yet, as the seemingly endless ages passed, the night elves' civilization expanded both territorially and culturally. Their temples, roads, and dwelling places stretched across the breadth of the dark continent. Azshara, the night elves' beautiful and gifted Queen, built an immense, wondrous palace on the Well's shore that housed her favored servitors within its bejeweled halls.

[page 644]
next_page=645
text=Her servitors, whom she called the Quel'dorei or -high-borne,- doted on her every command and believed themselves to be greater than the rest of their lower-caste brethren. Though Queen Azshara was loved equally by all of her people, the high-borne were secretly hated by the jealous masses.
text=
text=Sharing the priests' curiosity towards the Well of Eternity, Azshara ordered the educated high-borne to plumb its secrets and reveal its true purpose in the world.

[page 645]
next_page=646
text=The high-borne buried themselves in their work and studied the Well ceaselessly. In time they developed the ability to manipulate and control the Well's cosmic energies. As their reckless experiments progressed, the high-borne found that they could use their newfound powers to either create or destroy at their leisure. The hapless high-borne had stumbled upon primitive magic and were now resolved to devote themselves to its mastery.

[page 646]
next_page=647
text=Although they agreed that magic was inherently dangerous if handled irresponsibly, Azshara and her highborne began to practice their spellcraft with reckless abandon. Cenarius and many of the wizened night elf scholars warned that only calamity would result from toying with the clearly volatile arts of magic. But, Azshara and her followers stubbornly continued to expand their burgeoning powers.

[page 647]
next_page=648
text=As their powers grew, a distinct change came over Azshara and the high-borne. The haughty, aloof upper class became increasingly callous and cruel towards their fellow night elves. A dark, brooding pall veiled Azshara's once entrancing beauty. She began to withdraw from her loving subjects and refused to interact with any but her trusted high-borne priests.

[page 648]
text=A young, brazen scholar named Furion Stormrage, who had spent much of his time studying the Well's effects, began to suspect that a terrible power was corrupting the high-borne and his beloved Queen. Though he could not conceive the evil that was to come, he knew that the night elves' lives would soon be changed forever....

text=
text=I would not be so hopeful if it were not for the boxes of paper and bottles that washed ashore with me.  I laugh now to think of all the time I spent on that ship cursing that I was stuck with a boatload of Alchemists and Scribes.

[page 697]
text=Diary - Day 512
text=
text=The bananas have started talking to me and I have learned a great deal about their culture.  I have ceased my senseless destruction of their homes and consumption of the young.  How little I knew then of the great civilization that I was destroying.
text=
text=On another topic I seem to be running low on bottles and paper.  When I first looked at those huge stacks of paper that washed ashore I thought they would be inexhaustible.  Woe with me, my diary must end soon.

text=The fiend of which I write is the worgen.
text=
text=Old, rural folklore may hearken to these creatures, for what farmer's child has not heard tales of beastly wolf-men stalking the woods and marshes outside his village?
text=
text=And truth may hide in such tales--perhaps they are warnings against the worgen, veiled as myths to frighten us.

[page 701]
next_page=702
text=But before such tales are dismissed, let me now assure the reader: worgen are real.  They may not be from our world, but avenues exist between their home and ours and powerful magics can pull them here.
text=
text=Such chants are best left unuttered, for wherever Worgen tread, they bring terror and bloodshed with them.

[page 702]
next_page=703
text=You will know a worgen by its resemblance to the wolves of our world.  When viewing a worgen one can easily see how its course hair, pointed ears and long snout are akin to the wolves we know.
text=
text=But you will just as quickly see its differences:  that course hair surrounds a powerful, two-legged body sporting long fangs and dagger-like claws.  And behind its howl lurks a malevolence possessed by no natural beast.

[page 703]
next_page=704
text=The worgens' home is a dark place, a place of nightmare.  If that world fosters locales safe from the cursed worgen, then my research has revealed no such bastions.
text=
text=And if one considers the ferocity and wickedness of the worgen, then it is likely no such bastions exist.
text=
text=It is surmised that the worgen are content to remain on their world, for although some worgen possess powerful magic, they have made no attempts to reach Azeroth on their own accord.
text=
text=And for this, we are fortunate.

[page 704]
next_page=705
text=As mentioned above, some worgen are skilled in mystic arts, and their magic is of darkness and corruption.
text=
text=Curses and supernatural poisons are common, so be forewarned--those who face worgen magicians should arm themselves with wards against shadow.

[page 705]
text=It is my hope that no Dalaran wizard seeks out the Worgen, even if done in light conscience.  For no pact may be struck, no secrets may be learned, no good can come from these beasts.
text=
text=They are best left to their world.  For if found in ours and not destroyed, then our peril will be dire...

text=The Old Gods are the will of our world.  In every storm there roars the laughter of an Old God.  The blaze of a wildfire is the heat of their gaze.  As Old Gods walk, the earth trembles and breaks, and lesser things scream and tear at their own flesh in despair.
text=
text=And despair they should, for just as fire shows no mercy to a child's curious hand, the Old Gods have no care for those beneath them.  At best, we are pawns.  At worst, we are playthings.

[page 796]

[page 872]
next_page=873
text=Some good whitestone oak - Before it was taken over, the mines below Moonbrook in Westfall had an abundance of the lumber; they used it in the construction of some of their more important lattices and tools because of its resilience to heat and pressure.
text=
text=It was brought down there after being shipped from overseas somewhere. It's a rare wood that is plenty strong enough to be used in the crafting of your weapon. If any of it's left in the mines, then the goblin woodcarvers would have it.

[page 873]
next_page=874
text=Refined Ore - There is a dwarf in Thelsamar, a smith that I trained with for some time, named Bailor Stonehand. He makes a very special alloy that I think would be perfect for your weapon. I expected a shipment of the alloy to arrive while I was in Ironforge, but I have yet to hear word from him.

text=A Kor Gem - From the tales I've been told, the gems are used by some spell casters to hold energy for their magics, making them even deadlier. A night elf I once helped, Thundris Windweaver, can tell you more since you will be speaking on my behalf. I believe one of the gem's stored energies can be used in your weapon's creation.

text=
text=Long had the children of the stars dwelled upon the banks of the shimmering waters of the eternal well. To all was known that Elune, Light of the Eternal Twilight, Aspect and Goddess of the Moon, dwelt within its waters at such time that she rested from her works. Upon the shores of the well did the children of the stars, favored of elune, build their homes. Even as their gaze was trained ever skyward, into the moonlit night.
Though there were many towns and places of habitation constructed upon the lakeshore, Ameth'Aran and Bashal'Aran were the foremost. Having the touch of Azshara, the Kaldorei's beloved Queen in their creation. Her favored servitors, those of Highborne, she brought to the twin towns to reside, and to govern them she placed Athrikus Narassin, though it would be that he would spend most of his days in his Tower of Althalaxx, some ways removed of the Towns.
His second, a mage known of his prowess in the arcane arts as much as with his physical abilities, was Asterion, who lived among the people of Bashal'Aran, and went many times to Ameth'Aran, to see to the needs and wants of its people.
And so it was, upon the shores of the Well of Eternity, the twin towns grew and prospered, while the world beneath the stars fell slowly to madness.

[page 954]
text=The Fall of Ameth'Aran
text=
text=The Earth trembled as the ancient trees in the enchanted forest were uprooted and toppled. The groves and glades tended by the sons and daughters of Cenarius and the stone towers of the Children of the Stars were brought to the rolling ground. There was our Queen, radiant even in the desperation, in the chaos that was the battles. The enchanted sky changed colors with the discharge of magic, with the explosions that threatened to tear the world asunder.
Brother fought brother, Chosen fought Blessed. It was not all the Highborne that fought. Some stood, transfixed, as the madness took them. Mighty cities and humble towns alike were felled around them.
In Ameth'Aran, all was in ruins, its people clinging to the ground as though that might spare them from the destruction. It was then that Athrikus Narassin, favored of Azshara, appeared to guide them to safety.
With a spell he could protect them, he would say. While around them, brother and sister, father and mother perished.
They would have life eternal, and have naught to fear from the sundering to come.

Regardless, I must make a move one way or another.  Perhaps a mad dash to the surface is the best course...

Bring the sticks to the Circle of Outer Binding, a circle of stones in those same highlands.  Place the sticks on the center stone in the circle and wait for lightning to strike it.  When it does, the Bolt Charged Bramble will be formed.

text=The Engineering Disciplines$B$BWhile it is arguable which race first devised the science of engineering on Azeroth, there is little argument as to which races are the main proponents of it in modern times: the gnomes and the goblins.  Their dedication to engineering as a collective whole has not only fueled fantastic inventions in what is arguably a magical Age of Invention, but it also fueled their intense racial rivalry.  Nowhere is this more evident than in their divergent disciplines.

[page 1272]
next_page=1273
text=Gnome Engineering$B$BThe gnomes as a race tend to excel in the design of items intended to manipulate and control the world around them.  While they maintain a cursory understanding of explosives and weaponry, gnome engineering focuses instead on items that quite literally try to make life easier and more accessible.  It is a discipline of theoretical possibilities made reality through gnomish know-how.  Some possibilities, however, are never fully realized.

[page 1273]
next_page=1274
text=Goblin Engineering$B$BAs a race that finds itself as neutral in almost every conflict, goblins have taken great steps to turn science into profit.  They embrace the practical applications of engineering, as evident in their radical designs of explosives, firearms, and machinery.  Goblin engineering only maintains a passing interest in engineering theory; their inventions usually don't have the issue of not working, but rather working too well.  It is certainly not for the faint of heart.

[page 1274]
next_page=1275
text=Discipline Study$B$BGnomes and goblins protect their knowledge from each other to such lengths that it is nigh impossible to access both sets of disciplines simultaneously.  Each race, regardless of political affiliations, keeps the knowledge of these disciplines available only to those who agree to forgo pursuit of the other's discipline.  If a student chooses to embrace gnome engineering, for example, then no knowledge of goblin engineering will ever be made available to them.

[page 1275]
next_page=1276
text=Permanent Decisions$B$BThe previous section highlighted an important point about the two engineering disciplines that must be reiterated for the sake of education.  A decision to engage in either of the two disciplines means that the opposing discipline's schemata will not be available for study.  While such finality may be daunting to the layman engineer, the seasoned one understands that gnomes and goblins guard their secrets with complete fervor; some knowledge is always better than none.

text=Greetings and Salutations, Adventurers!
text=
text=I, Krinkle Goodsteel, have need of those willing to put themselves at risk in order to complete some of my most arduous tasks. Because of my many duties and the workload I've managed to take upon myself, I ensure that anyone brave enough to complete this list of items and return them to me intact will be paid handsomely.
text=
text=The list is contained on the following pages...

[page 1552]
next_page=1553
text=Solid Crystal Leg Shafts -
text=
text=The Glassweb spiders of Searing Gorge are made of an incredible crystal-like material. Their legs, if not damaged when they're killed, make for a wonderful conductor in some of my companions' engineering experiments.
text=
text=I will need a number of them to test  upon. The spiders having eight possible legs themselves should be no problem for a stalwart warrior or practiced mage.

[page 1553]
next_page=1554
text=An Overdue Package -
text=
text=I hired someone who I thought was a reliable pilot to bring me a package from Theramore. I was apparently wrong. And even though the pilot lived to tell the tale, he left his entire zepplin and all of its cargo behind to save his own neck.
text=
text=Well, I need that package back. From what Beezil tells me, he crashed just west of the bay in Dustwallow Marsh. It went down just after he crossed the hills along the water's edge.
text=
text=Hmmm... never did tell me what caused him to crash...

[page 1554]
next_page=1556
text=Goodsteel's Balanced Flameberge -
text=
text=Finally, I want one of my finest works of blacksmithing to date. This flameberge was an incredible sword that I bestowed upon what I thought was a very honorable and great warrior. Well, he was trounced by a murloc named Jarquai? Something like that.
text=
text=It was while he was traveling along the coast of the Swamp of Sorrows when he thought to attack the creature. He failed and apparently fled, but not before leaving the weapon behind for this murloc to take.

[page 1556]
text=Find me these items and return to Gadgetzan with them all, along with this ledger, and I will reward you.

text=Urgent message to Cliffwatcher Longhorn$b$bA large Centaur force from Camp E'thok have raided one of our supply caravans. All members of the caravan were lost as well as all supplies. This was a bold, unprecedented attack by the Centaurs and I fear there may be more.

[page 1751]
text=The remains of the gargantuan red dragon were found in the Wetlands shortly after the Battle of Grim Batol. Tyrannistrasz was rumored to have been the elder consort of the Dragonqueen, Alextrasza.

[page 1752]
text=This petrified talon was found off of the southern coasts of Stranglethorn. Ecologists believe this talon to be that of an ancient sun roc. Though the creatures feature prominently in primitive tauren mythological cycles, the existence of this talon suggests the creatures truly existed at some point.

[page 1753]
text=The largest of the plainstrider birds, the Geru are few in number and rarely encountered.

[page 1754]
text=This is a scale replica of Toothgnasher's skeleton. The legendary ram was a wonder of Khaz Modan and the subject of many tales of dwarven folklore. To this day, ecologists have been unable to account for the ram's freakish size or physical stamina.

[page 1755]
text=Found in the remote rainforest of the Un'Goro Crater, this egg once held an embryonic Devilsaur. The saurial's genetic material has proven invaluable to League ecologists who are closer than ever to devising a serum for the devilsaurs' debilitating venom.

[page 1756]
text=This intact pteradon skeleton was recovered from the remote Un'Goro Crater. Based on the skeletal structure, it is clear that this specific genus has not yet been encountered. This skeleton could have been preserved for any number of centuries beneath the region's rich soil.

[page 1757]
text=Recovered from the undersea ruins of Suramar, this functional astrolabe was crafted by the highborne night elves nearly twelve thousand years ago. The highborne, obsessed with magic, the occult and astronomy, developed a series of ingenious apparatuses. This device provides invaluable insights into the ancient night elves' level of scientific understanding.

[page 1758]
text=These ancient pieces of earthenware were recovered from the Uldaman excavation. Though they hold little in the way of suggestive runes or hieroglyphs, they do provide a telling look at the craftsmanship and day to day accessories of the ancient dwarven race.

[page 1759]
text=These etched relief runners were perhaps the most significant find within the first chambers of Uldaman. The etchings clearly suggest a tie between the golem-like earthen and the dwarven race. Should further evidence arise, the theories of our supposed creation by the mythic titans could prove to be true.

[page 1760]
text=Found in the sweltering wastes of the Tanaris desert, this peculiar egg remains a mystery to modern ecologists. Dating tests suggest the egg could be up to a thousand years old. Though certain elements denote insectoid structure, its true origins cannot be discerned.  The species that lays such distinct eggs still remains to be discovered.

[page 1761]
text=This remnant from the Second War serves as a stirring reminder of just how perilously close the Horde came to conquering Ironforge Mountain.

next_page=1774
text=Over time, demonic entities made their way into the Titans' worlds from the Twisting Nether, and the Pantheon elected its greatest warrior, Sargeras, to act as its first line of defense. A noble giant of molten bronze, Sargeras carried out his duties for countless millennia, seeking out and destroying these demons wherever he could find them. Over the eons, Sargeras encountered two powerful demonic races, both of which were bent on gaining power and dominance over the physical universe.

[page 1774]
next_page=1775
text=The eredar, an insidious race of devilish sorcerers, used their warlock magics to invade and enslave a number of worlds. The indigenous races of those worlds were mutated by the eredar's malevolent powers and turned into demons themselves.

[page 1775]
next_page=1776
text=Though Sargeras' nearly limitless powers were more than enough to defeat the vile eredar, he was greatly troubled by the creatures' corruption and all-consuming evil. Incapable of fathoming such depravity, the great Titan began to slip into a brooding depression. Despite his growing unease, Sargeras rid the universe of the warlocks by trapping them within a corner of the Twisting Nether.

[page 1776]
next_page=1777
text=While his confusion and misery deepened, Sargeras was forced to contend with another group intent on disrupting the Titans' order: the Nathrezim. This dark race of vampiric demons (also known as dreadlords) conquered a number of populated worlds by possessing their inhabitants and turning them to the shadow.

[page 1777]
next_page=1778
text=The nefarious, scheming dreadlords turned whole nations against one another by manipulating them into unthinking hatred and mistrust. Sargeras defeated the Nathrezim easily, but their corruption affected him deeply.

[page 1778]
next_page=1779
text=As doubt and despair overwhelmed Sargeras' senses, he lost all faith not only in his mission, but also in the Titans' vision of an ordered universe. Eventually he came to believe that the concept of order itself was folly, and that chaos and depravity were the only absolutes within the dark, lonely universe.

[page 1779]
next_page=1780
text=His fellow Titans tried to persuade him of his error and calm his raging emotions, but he disregarded their more optimistic beliefs as self-serving delusions. Storming from their ranks forever, Sargeras set out to find his own place in the universe. Although the Pantheon was sorrowful at his departure, the Titans could never have predicted just how far their lost brother would go.

[page 1780]
next_page=1781
text=By the time Sargeras' madness had consumed the last vestiges of his valiant spirit, he believed that the Titans themselves were responsible for creation's failure. Deciding, at last, to undo their works throughout the universe, he resolved to form an unstoppable army that would set the physical universe aflame.

[page 1781]
next_page=1782
text=Even Sargeras' titanic form became distorted from the corruption that plagued his once-noble heart. His eyes, hair, and beard erupted in fire, and his metallic bronze skin split open to reveal an endless furnace of blistering hate.

[page 1782]
next_page=1783
text=In his fury, Sargeras shattered the prisons of the eredar and the Nathrezim and set the loathsome demons free. These cunning creatures bowed before the dark Titan's vast rage and offered to serve him in whatever malicious ways they could. From the ranks of the powerful Eredar, Sargeras picked two champions to command his demonic army of destruction.

[page 1783]
next_page=1784
text=Kil'jaeden the Deceiver was chosen to seek out the darkest races in the universe and recruit them into Sargeras' ranks. The second champion, Archimonde the Defiler, was chosen to lead Sargeras' vast armies into battle against any who might resist the Titan's will.

[page 1784]
next_page=1785
text=Kil'jaeden's first move was to enslave the vampiric dreadlords under his terrible power. The dreadlords served as his personal agents throughout the universe, and they took pleasure in locating primitive races for their master to corrupt and bring into the fold. First amongst the dreadlords was Tichondrius the Darkener. Tichondrius served Kil'jaeden as the perfect soldier and agreed to bring Sargeras' burning will to all the dark corners of the universe.

[page 1785]
next_page=1786
text=The mighty Archimonde also empowered agents of his own. Calling upon the malefic pit lords and their barbarous leader, Mannoroth the Destructor, Archimonde hoped to establish a fighting elite that would scour creation of all life.

[page 1786]
text=Once Sargeras saw that his armies were amassed and ready to follow his every command, he launched his raging forces into the vastness of the Great Dark. He referred to his growing army as the Burning Legion. To this date, it is still unclear how many worlds they consumed and burned on their unholy Burning Crusade across the universe.

[page 1787]
next_page=1788
text=Unaware of Sargeras' mission to undo their countless works, the Titans continued to move from world to world, shaping and ordering each planet as they saw fit. Along their journey they happened upon a small world that its inhabitants would later name Azeroth.

[page 1788]
next_page=1789
text=As the Titans made their way across the primordial landscape, they encountered a number of hostile elemental beings. These elementals, who worshipped a race of unfathomably evil beings known only as the Old Gods, vowed to drive the Titans back and keep their world inviolate from the invaders' metallic touch.

[page 1789]
next_page=1790
text=The Pantheon, disturbed by the Old Gods' penchant for evil, waged war upon the elementals and their dark masters. The Old Gods' armies were led by the most powerful elemental lieutenants: Ragnaros the Firelord, Therazane the Stonemother, Al'Akir the Windlord, and Neptulon the Tidehunter.

[page 1790]
next_page=1791
text=Their chaotic forces raged across the face of the world and clashed with the colossal Titans. Though the elementals were powerful beyond mortal comprehension, their combined forces could not stop the mighty Titans. One by one, the elemental lords fell, and their forces dispersed.

[page 1791]
next_page=1792
text=The Pantheon shattered the Old Gods' citadels and chained the five evil gods far beneath the surface of the world. Without the Old Gods' power to keep their raging spirits bound to the physical world, the elementals were banished to an abyssal plane, where they would contend with one another for all eternity. With the elementals' departure, nature calmed, and the world settled into a peaceful harmony. The Titans saw that the threat was contained and set to work.

[page 1792]
next_page=1793
text=The Titans empowered a number of races to help them fashion the world. To help them carve out the fathomless caverns beneath the earth, the Titans created the dwarf-like earthen from magical, living stone. To help them dredge out the seas and lift the land from the sea floor, the Titans created the immense but gentle sea giants. For many ages the Titans moved and shaped the earth, until at last there remained one perfect continent.

[page 1793]
next_page=1794
text=At the continent's center, the Titans crafted a lake of scintillating energies. The lake, which they named the Well of Eternity, was to be the fount of life for the world. Its potent energies would nurture the bones of the world and empower life to take root in the land's rich soil. Over time, plants, trees, monsters, and creatures of every kind began to thrive on the primordial continent.

[page 1794]
text=As twilight fell on the final day of their labors, the Titans named the continent Kalimdor: "land of eternal starlight".

[page 1795]
next_page=1796
text=Satisfied that the small world had been ordered and that their work was done, the Titans prepared to leave Azeroth. However, before they departed, they charged the greatest species of the world with the task of watching over Kalimdor, lest any force should threaten its perfect tranquility. In that age, there were many dragonflights.

[page 1796]
next_page=1797
text=Yet there were five flights that held dominion over their brethren. It was these five flights that the Titans chose to shepherd the budding world. The greatest members of the Pantheon imbued a portion of their power upon each of the flights' leaders. These majestic dragons (as listed below) became known as the Great Aspects, or the Dragon Aspects.

[page 1797]
next_page=1798
text=Aman'Thul, the Highfather of the Pantheon, bestowed a portion of his cosmic power upon the massive bronze dragon, Nozdormu. The Highfather empowered Nozdormu to guard time itself and police the ever-spinning pathways of fate and destiny. The stoic, honorable Nozdormu became known as the Timeless One.

[page 1798]
next_page=1799
text=Eonar, the Titan patron of all life, gave a portion of her power to the red leviathan, Alexstrasza. Ever after, Alexstrasza would be known as the Life-Binder, and she would work to safeguard all living creatures within the world. Due to her supreme wisdom and limitless compassion for all living things, Alexstrasza was crowned the Dragonqueen and given dominion over her kind.

[page 1799]
next_page=1800
text=Eonar also blessed Alexstrasza's younger sister, the lithe green dragon Ysera, with a portion of nature's influence. Ysera fell into an eternal trance, bound to the waking Dream of Creation. Known as the Dreamer, she would watch over the growing wilds of the world from her verdant realm, the Emerald Dream.

[page 1800]
next_page=1801
text=Norgannon, the Titan lore keeper and master-magician, granted the blue dragon, Malygos, a portion of his vast power. From then on, Malygos would be known as the Spell-Weaver, the guardian of magic and hidden arcanum.

[page 1801]
next_page=1802
text=Khaz'goroth, the Titan shaper and forger of the world, bestowed some of his vast power upon the mighty black wyrm, Neltharion. The great-hearted Neltharion, known afterwards as the Earth-Warder, was given dominion over the earth and the deep places of the world. He embodied the strength of the world and served as Alexstrasza's greatest supporter.

[page 1802]
text=Thus empowered, the Five Aspects were charged with the world's defense in the Titans' absence. With the dragons prepared to safeguard their creation, the Titans left Azeroth behind forever. Unfortunately it was only a matter of time before Sargeras learned of the newborn world's existence....

[page 1803]
next_page=1804
text=The Highborne's reckless use of magic sent ripples of energy spiraling out from the Well of Eternity and into the Great Dark Beyond. The streaming ripples of energy were felt by terrible alien minds. Sargeras - the Great Enemy of all life, the Destroyer of Worlds - felt the potent ripples and was drawn to their distant point of origin.

[page 1804]
next_page=1805
text=Spying the primordial world of Azeroth and sensing the limitless energies of the Well of Eternity, Sargeras was consumed by an insatiable hunger. The great dark god of the Nameless Void resolved to destroy the fledgling world and claim its energies as his own.

[page 1805]
next_page=1806
text=Sargeras gathered his vast Burning Legion and made his way towards the unsuspecting world of Azeroth. The Legion was comprised of a million screaming demons, all ripped from the far corners of the universe, and the demons hungered for conquest. Sargeras' lieutenants, Archimonde the Defiler and Mannoroth the Destructor, prepared their infernal minions to strike.

[page 1806]
next_page=1807
text=Queen Azshara, overwhelmed by the terrible ecstasy of her magic, fell victim to Sargeras' undeniable power and agreed to grant him entrance to her world. Even her Highborne servitors gave themselves over to magic's inevitable corruption and began to worship Sargeras as their god. To show their allegiance to the Legion, the Highborne aided their queen in opening a vast, swirling portal within the depths of the Well of Eternity.

[page 1807]
next_page=1808
text=Once all his preparations had been made, Sargeras began his catastrophic invasion of Azeroth. The warrior-demons of the Burning Legion stormed into the world through the Well of Eternity and laid siege to the night elves' sleeping cities. Led by Archimonde and Mannoroth, the Legion swarmed over the lands of Kalimdor, leaving only ash and sorrow in its wake.

[page 1808]
next_page=1809
text=The demon warlocks called down searing infernals that crashed like hellish meteors into the graceful spires of Kalimdor's temples. A band of burning, bloodletting killers known as the Doomguard marched across Kalimdor's fields, slaughtering everyone in their path. Packs of wild, demonic felhounds ravaged the countryside unopposed. Though the brave Kaldorei warriors rushed to defend their ancient homeland, they were forced to give ground, inch by inch, before the fury of the Legion's onslaught.

[page 1809]
next_page=1810
text=It fell to Malfurion Stormrage to find help for his beleaguered people. Stormrage, whose own brother, Illidan, practiced the Highborne's magics, was incensed by the growing corruption amongst the upper class. Convincing Illidan to forsake his dangerous obsession, Malfurion set out to find Cenarius and muster a resistance force.

[page 1810]
next_page=1811
text=The beautiful young priestess, Tyrande, agreed to accompany the brothers in the name of Elune. Though Malfurion and Illidan shared a love for the idealistic priestess, Tyrande's heart belonged to Malfurion alone. Illidan resented his brother's budding romance with Tyrande, but knew that his heartache was nothing compared to the pain of his magical addiction.

[page 1811]
next_page=1812
text=Illidan, who had grown dependent on magic's empowering energies, struggled to keep control of his nearly overwhelming hunger to tap the Well's energies once again. However, with Tyrande's patient support, he was able to restrain himself and help his brother find the reclusive demigod, Cenarius.

[page 1812]
next_page=1813
text=Cenarius, who dwelt within the sacred Moonglades of the distant Mount Hyjal, agreed to help the night elves by finding the ancient dragons and enlisting their aid. The dragons, led by the great red leviathan, Alexstrasza, agreed to send their mighty flights to engage the demons and their infernal masters.

[page 1813]
next_page=1814
text=Cenarius, calling on the spirits of the enchanted forests, rallied an army of ancient tree-men and led them against the Legion in a daring ground assault. As the night elves' allies converged upon Azshara's temple and the Well of Eternity, all-out warfare erupted. Despite the strength of their newfound allies, Malfurion and his colleagues realized that the Legion could not be defeated by martial strength alone.

[page 1814]
next_page=1815
text=As the titanic battle raged around Azshara's capital city, the delusional queen waited in anticipation for Sargeras' arrival. The lord of the Legion was preparing to pass through the Well of Eternity and enter the ravaged world. As his impossibly huge shadow drew ever closer to the Well's surface, Azshara gathered the most powerful of her Highborne followers. Only by linking their magics together in one focused spell would they be able to create a gateway large enough for Sargeras to enter.

text=As the battle raged across the burning fields of Kalimdor, a terrible turn of events unfolded. The details of the event have been lost to time, but it is known that Neltharion, the Dragon Aspect of the Earth, went mad during a critical engagement against the Burning Legion. He began to split apart as flame and rage erupted from his dark hide. Renaming himself Deathwing, the burning dragon turned on his brethren and drove the five dragonflights from the field of battle.

[page 1816]
next_page=1817
text=Deathwing's sudden betrayal was so destructive that the five dragonflights never truly recovered. Wounded and shocked, Alexstrasza and the other noble dragons were forced to abandon their mortal allies. Malfurion and his companions, now hopelessly outnumbered, barely survived the ensuing onslaught.

[page 1817]
text=Malfurion, convinced that the Well of Eternity was the demons' umbilical link to the physical world, insisted that it should be destroyed. His companions, knowing that the Well was the source of their immortality and powers, were horrified by the rash notion. Yet Tyrande saw the wisdom of Malfurion's theory, so she convinced Cenarius and their comrades to storm Azshara's temple and find a way to shut the Well down for good.

[page 1828]
next_page=1829
text=The few night elves that survived the horrific explosion rallied together on crudely made rafts and slowly made their way to the only landmass in sight. Somehow, by the grace of Elune, Malfurion, Tyrande, and Cenarius had survived the Great Sundering. The weary heroes agreed to lead their fellow survivors and establish a new home for their people.

[page 1829]
next_page=1830
text=As they journeyed in silence, they surveyed the wreckage of their world and realized that their passions had wrought the destruction all around them. Though Sargeras and his Legion had been ripped from the world by the Well's destruction, Malfurion and his companions were left to ponder the terrible cost of victory.

[page 1830]
next_page=1831
text=There were many Highborne who did survive the cataclysm unscathed. They made their way to the shores of the new land along with the other night elves. Though Malfurion mistrusted the Highborne's motivations, he was satisfied that they could cause no real mischief without the Well's energies.

[page 1831]
next_page=1832
text=As the weary mass of night elves landed upon the shores of the new land, they found that the holy mountain, Hyjal, had survived the catastrophe. Seeking to establish a new home for themselves, Malfurion and the night elves climbed the slopes of Hyjal and reached its windswept summit. As they descended into the wooded bowl, nestled between the mountain's enormous peaks, they found a small, tranquil lake. To their horror, they found that the lake's waters had been fouled by magic.

[page 1832]
next_page=1833
text=Illidan, having survived the Sundering as well, had reached Hyjal summit long before Malfurion and the night elves. In his mad bid to maintain the flows of magic in the world, Illidan had poured his vials, which contained the precious waters from the Well of Eternity, into the mountain lake.

[page 1833]
next_page=1834
text=The Well's potent energies quickly ignited and coalesced into a new Well of Eternity. The exultant Illidan, believing that the new Well was a gift to future generations, was shocked when Malfurion hunted him down. Malfurion explained to his brother that magic was innately chaotic and that its use would inevitably lead to widespread corruption and strife. Still, Illidan refused to relinquish his magical powers.

[page 1834]
next_page=1835
text=Knowing full well where Illidan's ruthless schemes would eventually lead, Malfurion decided to deal with his power-crazed brother once and for all. With Cenarius' help, Malfurion sealed Illidan within a vast underground barrow prison, where he would remain chained and powerless until the end of time. To ensure his brother's containment, Malfurion empowered the young warden, Maiev Shadowsong, to be Illidan's personal jailor.

[page 1835]
text=Concerned that destroying the new Well might bring about an even greater catastrophe, the night elves resolved to leave it be. However, Malfurion declared that they would never practice the arts of magic again. Under Cenarius' watchful eye, they began to study the ancient arts of druidism that would enable them to heal the ravaged earth and re-grow their beloved forests at the base of Mount Hyjal.

[page 1836]
next_page=1837
text=For many years, the night elves worked tirelessly to rebuild what they could of their ancient homeland. Leaving their broken temples and roads to be overgrown, they constructed their new homes amidst the verdant trees and shadowed hills at Hyjal's base. In time, the dragons that had survived the great Sundering came forth from their secret abodes.

[page 1837]
next_page=1838
text=Alexstrasza the red, Ysera the green, and Nozdormu the bronze descended upon the druids' tranquil glades and surveyed the fruits of the night elves' labors. Malfurion, who had become an arch-druid of immense power, greeted the mighty dragons and told them about the creation of the new Well of Eternity.

[page 1838]
next_page=1839
text=The great dragons were alarmed to hear the dark news and speculated that as long as the Well remained, the Legion might one day return and assault the world once again. Malfurion and the three dragons made a pact to keep the Well safe and ensure that the agents of the Burning Legion would never find their way back into the world.

[page 1839]
next_page=1840
text=Alexstrasza, the Lifebinder, placed a single, enchanted acorn within the heart of the Well of Eternity. The acorn, activated by the potent, magical waters, sprung to life as a colossal tree. The mighty tree's roots grew from the Well's waters, and its verdant canopy seemed to scrape the roof of the sky.

[page 1840]
next_page=1841
text=The immense tree would be an everlasting symbol of the night elves' bond with nature, and its life-giving energies would extend out to heal the rest of the world over time. The night elves' gave their World Tree the new name Nordrassil, which meant "crown of the heavens" in their native tongue.

[page 1841]
next_page=1842
text=Nozdormu, the Timeless, placed an enchantment upon the World Tree to ensure that as long as the colossal tree stood, the night elves would never age or fall prey to sickness or disease.

[page 1842]
next_page=1843
text=Ysera, the Dreamer, also placed an enchantment upon the World Tree by linking it to her own realm, the ethereal dimension known as the Emerald Dream. The Emerald Dream, a vast, ever-changing spirit world, existed outside the boundaries of the physical world. From the Dream, Ysera regulated the ebb and flow of nature and the evolutionary path of the world itself.

[page 1843]
text=The night elf druids, including Malfurion himself, were bound to the Dream through the World Tree. As part of the mystical pact, the druids agreed to sleep for centuries at a time so that their spirits could roam the infinite paths of Ysera's Dreamways. Though the druids were grieved at the prospect of losing so many years of their lives to hibernation, they selflessly agreed to uphold their bargain with Ysera.

[page 1844]
next_page=1845
text=As the centuries passed, the night elves' new society grew strong and expanded throughout the budding forest that they came to call Ashenvale. Many of the creatures and species that were abundant before the Great Sundering, such as furbolgs and quilboars, reappeared and flourished in the land. Under the druids' benevolent leadership, the night elves enjoyed an era of unprecedented peace and tranquility under the stars.

[page 1845]
next_page=1846
text=However, many of the original Highborne survivors grew restless. Like Illidan before them, they fell victim to the withdrawal that came from the loss of their coveted magics. They were tempted to tap the energies of the Well of Eternity and exult in their magical practices. Dath'Remar, the brash, outspoken leader of the Highborne, began to mock the druids publicly, calling them cowards for refusing to wield the magic that he said was theirs by right.

[page 1846]
next_page=1847
text=Malfurion and the druids dismissed Dath'Remar's arguments and warned the Highborne that any use of magic would be punishable by death. In an insolent and ill-fated attempt to convince the druids to rescind their law, Dath'Remar and his followers unleashed a terrible magical storm upon Ashenvale.

[page 1847]
next_page=1848
text=The druids could not bring themselves to put so many of their kin to death, so they decided to exile the reckless Highborne from their lands. Dath'Remar and his followers, glad to be rid of their conservative cousins at last, boarded a number of specially crafted ships and set sail upon the seas. Though none of them knew what awaited them beyond the waters of the raging Maelstrom, they were eager to establish their own homeland, where they could practice their coveted magics with impunity.

[page 1848]
text=The Highborne, or Quel'dorei, as Azshara had named them in ages past, would eventually set shore upon the eastern land men would call Lordaeron. They planned to build their own magical kingdom, Quel'Thalas, and reject the night elves' precepts of moon worship and nocturnal activity. Forever after, they would embrace the sun and be known only as the high elves.

[page 1849]
next_page=1850
text=With the departure of their wayward cousins, the night elves turned their attention back to the safekeeping of their enchanted homeland. The druids, sensing that their time of hibernation was drawing near, prepared to sleep and leave their loved ones and families behind.

[page 1850]
next_page=1851
text=Tyrande, who had become the High Priestess of Elune, asked her love, Malfurion, not to leave her for Ysera's Emerald Dream. But Malfurion, honor bound to enter the changing Dreamways, bid the priestess farewell and swore that they would never be apart so long as they held true to their love.

[page 1851]
next_page=1852
text=Left alone to protect Kalimdor from the dangers of the new world, Tyrande assembled a powerful fighting force from amongst her night elf sisters. The fearless, highly trained warrior women who pledged themselves to Kalimdor's defense became known as the Sentinels. Though they preferred to patrol the shadowy forests of Ashenvale on their own, they had many allies upon which they could call in times of urgency.

[page 1852]
next_page=1853
text=The demigod Cenarius remained nearby in the Moonglades of Mount Hyjal. His sons, known as the Keepers of the Grove, kept close watch on the night elves and regularly helped the Sentinels maintain peace in the land. Even Cenarius' shy daughters, the dryads, appeared in the open with increasing frequency.

[page 1853]
text=The task of policing Ashenvale kept Tyrande busy, but without Malfurion at her side, she knew little joy. As the long centuries passed while the druids slept, her fears of a second demonic invasion grew. She could not shake the unnerving feeling that the Burning Legion might still be out there, beyond the Great Dark of the sky, plotting its revenge upon the night elves and the world of Azeroth.

[page 1854]
next_page=1855
text=The high elves, led by Dath'Remar, left Kalimdor behind them and challenged the storms of the Maelstrom. Their fleets wandered the wreckage of the world for many long years, and they discovered mysteries and lost kingdoms along their sojourn. Dath'Remar, who had taken the name Sunstrider (or "he who walks the day"), sought out places of considerable ley power upon which to build a new homeland for his people.

[page 1855]
next_page=1856
text=His fleet finally landed on the beaches of the kingdom men would later call Lordaeron. Forging inland, the high elves founded a settlement within the tranquil Tirisfal Glades. After a few years, many of them began to go mad. It was theorized that something evil slept beneath that particular part of the world, but the rumors were never proven to be true. The high elves packed up their encampment and moved northward towards another land rich with ley energies.

[page 1856]
next_page=1857
text=As the high elves crossed the rugged, mountainous lands of Lordaeron, their journey became more perilous. Since they were effectively cut off from the life-giving energies of the Well of Eternity, many of them fell ill from the frigid climate or died from starvation. The most disconcerting change, however, was the fact that they were no longer immortal or immune to the elements.

[page 1857]
next_page=1858
text=They also shrank somewhat in height, and their skin lost its characteristic violet hue. Despite their hardships, they encountered many wondrous creatures that had never been seen in Kalimdor. They also found tribes of primitive humans who hunted throughout the ancient forestlands. However, the direst threat they encountered were the voracious and cunning forest trolls of Zul'Aman.

[page 1858]
next_page=1859
text=These moss-skinned trolls could regenerate lost limbs and heal grievous physical injuries, but they proved to be a barbaric, evil race. The Amani empire stretched across most of northern Lordaeron, and the trolls fought hard to keep unwanted strangers from their borders. The elves developed a deep loathing for the vicious trolls and killed them on sight whenever they were encountered.

[page 1859]
next_page=1860
text=After many long years, the high elves finally found a land which was reminiscent of Kalimdor. Deep within the northern forests of the continent, they founded the kingdom of Quel'Thalas and vowed to create a mighty empire which would dwarf that of their Kaldorei cousins. Unfortunately they soon learned that Quel'Thalas was founded upon an ancient troll city that the trolls still held to be sacred. Almost immediately, the trolls began to attack the elven settlements en masse.

[page 1860]
next_page=1861
text=The stubborn elves, unwilling to give up their new land, utilized the magics which they had gleaned from the Well of Eternity and kept the savage trolls at bay. Under Dath'Remar's leadership, they were able to defeat the Amani warbands that outnumbered them ten to one. Some elves, wary of the Kaldorei's ancient warnings, felt that their use of magic might possibly draw the attention of the banished Burning Legion.

[page 1861]
next_page=1862
text=Therefore, they decided to mask their lands within a protective barrier which would still allow them to work their enchantments. They constructed a series of monolithic Runestones at various points around Quel'Thalas which marked the boundaries of the magic barrier. The Runestones not only masked the elves' magic from extra-dimensional threats, but helped to frighten away the superstitious troll warbands as well.

[page 1862]
next_page=1863
text=As time wore on, Quel'Thalas became a shining monument to the high elves' efforts and magical prowess. Its beauteous palaces were crafted in the same architectural style as the ancient halls of Kalimdor, yet they were interwoven with the natural topography of the land. Quel'Thalas had become the shining jewel that the elves had longed to create.

[page 1863]
next_page=1864
text=The Convocation of Silvermoon was founded as the ruling power over Quel'Thalas, though the Sunstrider Dynasty maintained a modicum of political power. Comprised of seven of the greatest high elf lords, the Convocation worked to secure the safety of the elven lands and people. Surrounded by their protective barrier, the high elves remained unmoved by the old warnings of the Kaldorei and continued to use magic flagrantly in almost all aspects of their lives.

[page 1864]
text=For nearly four thousand years the high elves lived peacefully within the secluded safety of their kingdom. Nevertheless, the vindictive trolls were not so easily defeated. They plotted and schemed in the depths of the forests and waited for the numbers of their warbands to grow. Finally, a mighty troll army charged out from the shadowy forests and once again laid siege to the shining spires of Quel'Thalas.

[page 1865]
next_page=1866
text=As the high elves fought for their lives against the trolls' fierce onslaught, the scattered, nomadic humans of Lordaeron fought to consolidate their own tribal lands. The tribes of early humanity raided each other's settlements with little heed for racial unification or honor.

[page 1866]
next_page=1867
text=Yet one tribe, known as the Arathi, saw that the trolls were becoming too great a threat to ignore. The Arathi wished to bring all of the tribes under its rule so that they could provide a unified front against the troll warbands.

[page 1867]
next_page=1868
text=Over the course of six years, the cunning Arathi outmaneuvered and outfought the rival tribes. After every victory, the Arathi offered peace and equality to the conquered people; thus, they won the loyalty of those they had beaten. Eventually the Arathi tribe came to include many disparate tribes, and the ranks of its army grew vast.

[page 1868]
next_page=1869
text=Confident that they could hold their own against the troll warbands or even the reclusive elves if need be, the Arathi warlords decided to construct a mighty fortress city in the southern regions of Lordaeron. The city-state, named Strom, became the capital of the Arathi nation, Arathor. As Arathor prospered, humans from all over the vast continent traveled south to the protection and safety of Strom.

[page 1869]
next_page=1870
text=United under one banner, the human tribes developed a strong, optimistic culture. Thoradin, the king of Arathor, knew that the mysterious elves in the northlands were under constant siege by the trolls, but refused to risk the safety of his people in defense of reclusive strangers. Many months passed as rumors of the elves' supposed defeat trickled down from the north. It was only when weary ambassadors from Quel'Thalas reached Strom that Thoradin realized how great the troll threat truly was.

[page 1870]
next_page=1871
text=The elves informed Thoradin that the troll armies were vast and that once the trolls had destroyed Quel'Thalas, they would move on to attack the southlands. The desperate elves, in dire need of military aid, hastily agreed to teach certain select humans to wield magic in exchange for their help against the warbands.

[page 1871]
next_page=1872
text=Thoradin, distrustful of any magic, agreed to aid the elves out of necessity. Almost immediately, elven sorcerers arrived in Arathor and began to instruct a group of humans in the ways of magic.

[page 1872]
next_page=1873
text=The elves found that although humans were innately clumsy in their handling of magic, they possessed a startling natural affinity for it. One hundred men were taught the very basics of the elves' magical secrets: no more than was absolutely necessary to combat the trolls. Convinced that their human students were ready to aid in the struggle, the elves left Strom and traveled north alongside the mighty armies of King Thoradin.

[page 1873]
next_page=1874
text=The united elf and human armies clashed against the overwhelming troll warbands at the foot of the Alterac Mountains. The battle lasted for many days, but the unflagging armies of Arathor never tired or gave an inch of ground before the troll onslaught. The elven lords deemed that the time had come to release the powers of their magic upon the enemy.

[page 1874]
next_page=1875
text=The hundred human magi and a multitude of elven sorcerers called down the fury of the heavens and set the troll armies ablaze. The elemental fires prevented the trolls from regenerating their wounds and burned their tortured forms from the inside out.

[page 1875]
text=As the troll armies broke and attempted to flee, Thoradin's armies ran them down and slaughtered every last one of their soldiers. The trolls would never fully recover from their defeat, and history would never see the trolls rise as one nation again. Assured that Quel'Thalas was saved from destruction, the elves made a pledge of loyalty and friendship to the nation of Arathor and to the bloodline of its king, Thoradin. Humans and elves would nurture peaceful relations for ages to come.
text=

[page 1876]
next_page=1877
text=With the absence of trolls in the northlands, the elves of Quel'Thalas bent their efforts towards rebuilding their glorious homeland. The victorious armies of Arathor returned home to southlands of Strom.

[page 1877]
next_page=1878
text=The human society of Arathor grew and prospered, yet Thoradin, fearful that his kingdom would splinter apart if it overextended itself, maintained that Strom was the center of the Arathorian empire. After many peaceful years of growth and commerce, mighty Thoradin died of old age, leaving Arathor's younger generation free to expand the empire beyond the lands of Strom.

[page 1878]
next_page=1879
text=The original hundred magi, who were tutored in the ways of magic by the elves, expanded their powers and studied the mystic disciplines of spell-weaving in much greater detail. These magi, initially chosen for their strong wills and noble spirits, had always practiced their magic with care and responsibility; however, they passed their secrets and powers onto a newer generation that had no concept of the rigors of war or the necessity for self-restraint.

[page 1879]
next_page=1880
text=These younger magicians began to practice magic for personal gain rather than out of any responsibility towards their fellows.

[page 1880]
next_page=1881
text=As the empire grew and expanded into new lands, the young magicians also spread out into the southlands. Wielding their mystical powers, the magicians protected their brethren from the wild creatures of the land and made it possible for new city-states to be constructed in the wilderness. Yet, as their powers grew, the magicians became ever more conceited and isolated from the rest of society.

[page 1881]
next_page=1882
text=The second Arathorian city-state of Dalaran was founded in the lands north of Strom. Many fledgling wizards left the restraining confines of Strom behind and traveled to Dalaran, where they hoped to use their new powers with greater freedom. These magicians used their skills to build up the enchanted spires of Dalaran and reveled in the pursuit of their studies.

[page 1882]
next_page=1883
text=The citizens of Dalaran tolerated the magicians' endeavors and built up a bustling economy under the protection of their magic-using defenders. Yet, as more and more magicians practiced their arts, the fabric of reality around Dalaran began to weaken and tear.

[page 1883]
next_page=1884
text=The sinister agents of the Burning Legion, who had been banished when the Well of Eternity collapsed, were lured back into the world by the heedless spellcasting of the magicians of Dalaran. Though these relatively weak demons did not appear in force, they did sew considerable confusion and chaos within the streets of Dalaran.

[page 1884]
next_page=1885
text=Most of these demonic encounters were isolated events, and the ruling Magocrats did what they could to keep such events hidden from the public. The most powerful magicians were sent to capture the elusive demons, but they often found themselves hopelessly outmatched by the lone agents of the mighty Legion.

[page 1885]
next_page=1886
text=After a few months the superstitious peasantry began to suspect that their sorcerous rulers were hiding something terrible from them. Rumors of revolution began to sweep through the streets of Dalaran as the paranoid citizenry questioned the motives and practices of the magicians they had once admired. The Magocrats, fearing that the peasants would revolt and that Strom would take action against them, turned to the only group they felt would understand their particular problem: the elves.

[page 1886]
next_page=1887
text=Upon hearing the Magocrats' news of demonic activity in Dalaran, the elves quickly dispatched their mightiest wizards to the human lands. The elven wizards studied the energy currents in Dalaran and made detailed reports of all demonic activity that they beheld. They concluded that although there were only a few demons loose in the world, the Legion itself would remain a dire threat so long as humans continued to wield the forces of magic.

[page 1887]
next_page=1888
text=The Council of Silvermoon, which ruled over the elves of Quel'Thalas, entered into a secret pact with the Magocrat lords of Dalaran. The elves told the Magocrats about the history of ancient Kalimdor and of the Burning Legion, a history which still threatened the world. They informed the humans that so long as they used magic, they would need to protect their citizenry from the malicious agents of the Legion.

[page 1888]
next_page=1889
text=The Magocrats proposed the notion of empowering a single mortal champion who would utilize their powers in order to fight a never-ending secret war against the Legion. It was stressed that the majority of mankind could never know about the Guardians or the threat of the Legion for fear that they would riot in fear and paranoia. The elves agreed to the proposal and founded a secret society that would watch over the selection of the Guardian and help to stem the rise of chaos in the world.

[page 1889]
next_page=1890
text=The society held its secret meetings in the shadowed Tirisfal Glades, where the high elves had first settled in Lordaeron. Thus, they named the secret sect the Guardians of Tirisfal. The mortal champions who were chosen to be Guardians were imbued with incredible powers of both elven and human magic. Though there would only ever be one Guardian at a time, they held such vast power that they could single-handedly fight back the Legion's agents wherever they were found in the world.

[page 1890]
next_page=1891
text=The Guardian power was so great that only the Council of Tirisfal was allowed to choose potential successors to the mantle of Guardianship. Whenever a Guardian grew too old, or wearied of the secret war against chaos, the Council chose a new champion, and under controlled conditions, formally channeled the Guardian power into its new agent.

[page 1891]
text=As the generations passed, Guardians defended the masses of humanity from the invisible threat of the Burning Legion throughout the lands of Arathor and Quel'Thalas. Arathor grew and prospered while the use of magic spread throughout the empire. Meanwhile, the Guardians kept careful watch for signs of demonic activity.

[page 1892]
next_page=1893
text=In the ancient times, after the Titans departed Azeroth, their children, known as the earthen, continued to shape and guard the deep recesses of the world. The earthen were largely unconcerned with the affairs of the surface-dwelling races and longed only to plumb the dark depths of the earth.

[page 1893]
next_page=1894
text=When the world was sundered by the Well of Eternity's implosion, the earthen were deeply affected. Reeling with the pain of the earth itself, the earthen lost much of their identity and sealed themselves within the stone chambers where they were first created. Uldaman, Uldum, Ulduar... these were the names of the ancient Titan cities where the earthen first took shape and form. Buried deep beneath the world, the earthen rested in peace for nearly eight thousand years.

[page 1894]
next_page=1895
text=Though it is unclear what awakened them, the earthen sealed within Uldaman eventually arose from their self-imposed slumber. These earthen found that they had changed significantly during their hibernation. Their rocky hides had softened and become smooth skin, and their powers over stone and earth had waned. They had become mortal creatures.

[page 1895]
next_page=1896
text=Calling themselves dwarves, the last of the earthen left the halls of Uldaman and ventured out into the waking world. Still lulled by the safety and wonders of the deep places, they founded a vast kingdom under the highest mountain in the land.

[page 1896]
next_page=1897
text=They named their land Khaz Modan, or "Mountain of Khaz", in honor of the Titan shaper, Khaz'goroth. Constructing an altar for their Titan father, the dwarves crafted a mighty forge within the heart of the mountain. Thus, the city that grew around the forge would be called Ironforge ever after.

[page 1897]
text=The dwarves, by nature fascinated with shaping gems and stone, set out to mine the surrounding mountains for riches and precious minerals. Content with their labors under the world, the dwarves remained isolated from the affairs of their surface-dwelling neighbors.

[page 1898]
next_page=1899
text=Strom continued to act as the central hub of Arathor, but as with Dalaran, many new city-states arose across the continent of Lordaeron. Gilneas, Alterac, and Kul Tiras were the first city-states to arise, and although they each had their own customs and commercial workings, they all held to the unifying authority of Strom.

[page 1899]
next_page=1900
text=Under the vigilant watch of the Order of Tirisfal, Dalaran became the chief center of learning for magicians throughout the land. The Magocrats who ruled Dalaran founded the Kirin Tor, a specialized sect that was charged with cataloguing and researching every spell, artifact, and magic item known to mankind at the time.

[page 1900]
next_page=1901
text=Gilneas and Alterac became strong supporters of Strom and developed mighty armies that explored the mountainous southern lands of Khaz Modan. It was during this period that humans first met the ancient race of dwarves and traveled to their cavernous subterranean city of Ironforge. The humans and dwarves shared many secrets of metal-smithing and engineering and discovered a common love for battle and storytelling.

[page 1901]
next_page=1902
text=The city-state of Kul Tiras, founded upon a large island south of Lordaeron, developed a prosperous economy based on fishing and shipping. Over time, Kul Tiras built up a mighty fleet of merchant vessels that sailed throughout the known lands in search of exotic goods to trade and sell. Yet even as the economy of Arathor flourished, its strongest elements began to disintegrate.

[page 1902]
next_page=1903
text=In time, the lords of Strom sought to move their estates to the lush northlands of Lordaeron and leave the arid lands of the south. The heirs of King Thoradin, the last descendants of the Arathi bloodline, argued that Strom should not be abandoned and thus incurred the displeasure of the greater citizenry, who were likewise eager to leave.

[page 1903]
next_page=1904
text=The lords of Strom, seeking to find purity and enlightenment in the untamed north, decided to leave their ancient city behind. Far to the north of Dalaran, the lords of Strom built a new city-state which they named Lordaeron. The entire continent would take its name from this city-state. Lordaeron became a mecca for religious travelers and all those who sought inner peace and security.

[page 1904]
next_page=1905
text=The descendents of the Arathi, left within the crumbling walls of ancient Strom, decided to travel south past the rocky mountains of Khaz Modan. Their journey finally ended after many long seasons, and they settled in the northern region of the continent they would name Azeroth. In a fertile valley they founded the kingdom of Stormwind, which quickly became a self-sufficient power in its own right.

[page 1905]
text=The few warriors still left in Strom decided to remain and guard the ancient walls of their city. Strom was no longer the center of the empire, but it developed into a new nation known as Stromgarde. Though each of the city-states became prosperous in its own right, the empire of Arathor had effectively disintegrated. As each nation developed its own customs and beliefs, they became increasingly segregated from one another. King Thoradin's vision of a unified humanity had faded at last.

[page 1906]
next_page=1907
text=As the politics and rivalries of the seven human nations waxed and waned, the line of Guardians kept its constant vigil against chaos. There were many Guardians over the years, but only one ever held the magical powers of Tirisfal at any given time. One of the last Guardians of the age distinguished herself as a mighty warrior against the shadow.

[page 1907]
next_page=1908
text=Aegwynn, a fiery human girl, won the approbation of the Order and was given the mantle of Guardianship. Aegwynn vigorously worked to hunt down and eradicate demons wherever she found them, but she often questioned the authority of the male-dominated Council of Tirisfal.

[page 1908]
next_page=1909
text=She believed that the ancient elves and the elderly men who presided over the council were too rigid in their thinking and not farsighted enough to put a decisive end to the conflict against chaos. Impatient with lengthy discussion and debate, she yearned to prove herself worthy to her peers and superiors, and as a result frequently chose valor over wisdom in crucial situations.

[page 1909]
next_page=1910
text=As her mastery over the cosmic power of Tirisfal grew, Aegwynn became aware of a number of powerful demons that stalked the icy northern continent of Northrend. Traveling to the distant north, Aegwynn tracked the demons into the mountains. There, she found that the demons were hunting one of the last surviving dragonflights and draining the ancient creatures of their innate magic.

[page 1910]
next_page=1911
text=The mighty dragons, who had fled from the ever-advancing march of mortal societies, found themselves too evenly matched against the dark magics of the Legion. Aegwynn confronted the demons, and with help from the noble dragons, eradicated them. Yet, as the last demon was banished from the mortal world, a great storm erupted throughout the north.

[page 1911]
next_page=1912
text= An enormous dark visage appeared in the sky above Northrend. Sargeras, the demon king and lord of the Burning Legion, appeared before Aegwynn and bristled with hellish energy. He informed the young Guardian that the time of Tirisfal was about to come to an end and that the world would soon bow before the onslaught of the Legion.

[page 1912]
next_page=1913
text=The proud Aegwynn, believing herself to be a match for the menacing god, unleashed her powers against Sargeras' avatar. With disconcerting ease, Aegwynn battered the demonlord with her powers and succeeded in killing his physical shell. Fearing that Sargeras' spirit would linger on, the na??? Aegwynn locked the ruined husk of his body within one of the ancient halls of Kalimdor that had been blasted to the bottom of the sea when the Well of Eternity collapsed.

[page 1913]
text=Aegwynn would never know that she had done exactly as Sargeras had planned. She had inadvertently sealed the fate of the mortal world, for Sargeras, at the time of his corporeal death, had transferred his spirit into Aegwynn's weakened body. Unbeknownst to the young Guardian, Sargeras would remain cloaked within the darkest recesses of her soul for many long years.

[page 1914]
next_page=1915
text=The dwarves of Ironforge Mountain lived in peace for many long centuries. However, their society grew too large within the confines of their mountain cities. Though the mighty High King, Modimus Anvilmar, ruled over all dwarves with justice and wisdom, three powerful factions had arisen amongst the dwarven society.

[page 1915]
next_page=1916
text=The Bronzebeard clan, ruled by Thane Madoran Bronzebeard, held close ties to the High King and stood as the traditional defenders of Ironforge Mountain. The Wildhammer clan, ruled by Thane Khardros Wildhammer, inhabited the foothills and crags around the base of the mountain and sought to gain more control within the city.

[page 1916]
next_page=1917
text=The third faction, the Dark Iron clan, was ruled by the sorcerer-thane Thaurissan. The Dark Irons hid within the deepest shadows under the mountain and plotted against both their Bronzebeard and the Wildhammer cousins.

[page 1917]
next_page=1918
text=For a time the three factions kept a tenuous peace, but tensions erupted when High King Anvilmar passed away from old age. The three ruling clans went to war for control of Ironforge itself. The dwarf civil war raged under the earth for many years. Eventually the Bronzebeards, who had the largest standing army, banished the Dark Irons and Wildhammers from under the mountain.

[page 1918]
next_page=1919
text=Khardros and his Wildhammer warriors traveled north through the barrier gates of Dun Algaz, and they founded their own kingdom within the distant peak of Grim Batol. There, the Wildhammers thrived and rebuilt their stores of treasure. Thaurissan and his Dark Irons did not fare as well. Humiliated and enraged by their defeat, they vowed revenge against Ironforge. Leading his people far to the south, Thaurissan founded a city (which he named after himself) within the beautiful Redridge Mountains.

[page 1919]
next_page=1920
text=Prosperity and the passing of years did little to ease the Dark Iron's rancor toward their cousins. Thaurissan and his sorceress wife, Modgud, launched a two-pronged assault against both Ironforge and Grim Batol. The Dark Irons were intent on claiming all of Khaz Modan for their own.

[page 1920]
next_page=1921
text=The Dark Iron armies smashed against their cousins' strongholds and very nearly took both kingdoms. However, Madoran Bronzebeard ultimately led his clan to a decisive victory over Thaurissan's sorcerous army. Thaurissan and his servants fled back to the safety of their city, unaware of the events transpiring at Grim Batol, where Modgud's army would fare no better against Khardros and his Wildhammer warriors.

[page 1921]
next_page=1922
text=As she confronted the enemy warriors, Modgud used her powers to strike fear into their hearts. Shadows moved at her command, and dark things crawled up from the depths of the earth to stalk the Wildhammers in their own halls. Eventually Modgud broke through the gates and laid siege to the fortress itself. The Wildhammers fought desperately, Khardros himself wading through the roiling masses to slay the sorceress queen.

[page 1922]
next_page=1923
text=With their queen lost, the Dark Irons fled before the fury of the Wildhammers. They raced south toward their king's stronghold, only to meet the armies of Ironforge, which had come to aid Grim Batol. Crushed between two armies, the remaining Dark Iron forces were utterly destroyed.

[page 1923]
next_page=1924
text=The combined armies of Ironforge and Grim Batol then turned south, intent on destroying Thaurissan and his Dark Irons once and for all. They had not gone far when Thaurissan's fury resulted in a spell of cataclysmic proportions. Seeking to summon a supernatural minion that would ensure his victory, Thaurissan called upon the ancient powers sleeping beneath the world. To his shock, and ultimately his doom, the creature that emerged was more terrible than any nightmare he could have imagined.

[page 1924]
next_page=1925
text=Ragnaros the Firelord, immortal lord of all fire elementals, had been banished by the Titans when the world was young. Now, freed by Thaurissan's call, Ragnaros erupted into being once again. Ragnaros' apocalyptic rebirth into Azeroth shattered the Redridge Mountains and created a raging volcano at the center of the devastation.

[page 1925]
next_page=1926
text=The volcano, known as Blackrock Mountain, was bordered by the Searing Gorge to the north and the Burning Steppes to the south. Though Thaurissan was killed by the forces he had unleashed, his surviving brethren were ultimately enslaved by Ragnaros and his elementals. They remain within the depths of Blackrock to this day.

[page 1926]
next_page=1927
text=Witnessing the horrific devastation and the fires spreading across the southern mountains, King Madoran and King Khardros halted their armies and hastily turned back towards their kingdoms, unwilling to face the awesome wrath of Ragnaros.

[page 1927]
next_page=1928
text=The Bronzebeards returned to Ironforge and rebuilt their glorious city. The Wildhammers also returned home to Grim Batol. However, the death of the Modgud had left an evil stain on the mountain fortress, and the Wildhammers found it uninhabitable.

[page 1928]
next_page=1929
text= They were bitter in their hearts over the loss of their beloved home. King Bronzebeard offered the Wildhammers a place to live within the borders of Ironforge, but the Wildhammers steadfastly refused. Khardros took his people north towards the lands of Lordaeron. Settling within the lush forests of the Hinterlands, the Wildhammers crafted the city of Aerie Peak, where the Wildhammers grew closer to nature and even bonded with the mighty gryphons of the area.

[page 1929]
next_page=1930
text=Seeking to retain relations and trade with their cousins, the dwarves of Ironforge constructed two massive arches, the Thandol Span, to bridge the gap between Khaz Modan and Lordaeron. Bolstered by mutual trade, the two kingdoms prospered. After the deaths of Madoran and Khardros, their sons jointly commissioned two great statues in honor of their fathers.

[page 1930]
next_page=1931
text=The two statues would stand guard over the pass into the southlands, which had become volcanic in the wake of Ragnaros' scorching presence. They served as both a warning to all who would attack the dwarven kingdoms, and as a reminder of what price the Dark Irons paid for their crimes.

[page 1931]
text=The two kingdoms retained close ties for some years, but the Wildhammers were much changed by the horrors they witnessed at Grim Batol. They took to living above ground on the slopes of Aerie Peak, instead of carving a vast kingdom within the mountain. The ideological differences between the two remaining dwarven clans eventually led to their parting of ways.

[page 1932]
next_page=1933
text=The Guardian Aegwynn grew powerful over the years and used the Tirisfal energies to greatly extend her life. Foolishly believing that she had defeated Sargeras for good, she continued to safeguard the world from the demon king's minions for nearly nine hundred years. However, the Council of Tirisfal finally decreed that her stewardship had come to an end.

[page 1933]
next_page=1934
text=The Council ordered Aegwynn to return to Dalaran so that they could choose a new successor for the Guardian power. Yet Aegwynn, ever distrustful of the Council, decided to choose a successor on her own.

[page 1934]
next_page=1935
text=The proud Aegwynn planned to give birth to a son whom she would divest her power to. She had no intention of allowing the Order of Tirisfal to manipulate her successor as they had tried to manipulate her. Traveling to the southern nation of Azeroth, Aegwynn found the perfect man to father her son: a skilled human magician known as Nielas Aran.

[page 1935]
next_page=1936
text=Aran was the court conjuror and advisor for Azeroth's king. Aegwynn seduced the magician and conceived a son by him. Nielas' natural affinity for magic would run deep within the unborn child and define the tragic steps the child would later take. The power of Tirisfal was also implanted in the child, yet it wasn't to awaken until he reached physical maturity.

[page 1936]
next_page=1937
text=Time passed, and Aegwynn gave birth to her son in a secluded grove. Naming the boy Medivh, which means "keeper of secrets" in the high elven tongue, Aegwynn believed that the boy would mature to become the next Guardian. Unfortunately the malignant spirit of Sargeras, which had been hiding inside her, had possessed the defenseless child while it was still in her womb. Aegwynn had no idea that the world's newest Guardian was already possessed by its greatest nemesis.

[page 1937]
next_page=1938
text=Certain that her baby was healthy and sound, Aegwynn delivered young Medivh to the court of Azeroth and left him there to be raised by his mortal father and his people. She then wandered into the wilderness and prepared to pass into whatever afterlife awaited her. Medivh grew to become a strong boy and had no idea of the potential power of his Tirisfalin birthright.

[page 1938]
next_page=1939
text=Sargeras bided his time until the youth's power manifested itself. By the time Medivh had reached his teenage years, he had become very popular in Azeroth for his magical prowess and often went off on adventures with his two friends: Llane, the prince of Azeroth, and Anduin Lothar, one of the last descendents of the Arathi bloodline. The three boys constantly caused mischief around the kingdom, but they were well liked by the general citizenry.

[page 1939]
next_page=1940
text=When Medivh reached the age of fourteen, the cosmic power inside him awakened and clashed with the pervasive spirit of Sargeras that lurked within his soul. Medivh fell into a catatonic state which lasted for many years.
text=

[page 1940]
next_page=1941
text=When he awakened from his coma, he found that he had grown to adulthood, and his friends Llane and Anduin had become the regents of Azeroth. Though he wished to use his incredible newfound powers to protect the land he called home, the dark spirit of Sargeras twisted his thoughts and emotions towards an insidious end.

[page 1941]
text=Sargeras reveled within the darkening heart of Medivh, for he knew that his plans for the second invasion of the world were nearing completion, and that the world's last Guardian would bring them all to fruition.

[page 1942]
next_page=1943
text=Around the time of Medivh's birth on Azeroth, Kil'jaeden the Deceiver sat and brooded amongst his followers within the Twisting Nether. The cunning demonlord, under orders of his master, Sargeras, was plotting the Burning Legion's second invasion of Azeroth.

[page 1943]
next_page=1944
text=This time he would not allow any mistakes. Kil'jaeden surmised that he needed a new force to weaken Azeroth's defenses before the Legion even set foot upon the world. If the mortal races, such as the night elves and dragons, were forced to contend with a new threat, they would be too weak to pose any real resistance when the Legion's true invasion arrived.

[page 1944]
next_page=1945
text=It was at this time that Kil'jaeden discovered the lush world of Draenor floating peacefully within the Great Dark Beyond. Home to the shamanistic, clan-based orcs and the peaceful draenei, Draenor was as idyllic as it was vast.

[page 1945]
next_page=1946
text=The noble orc clans roamed the open prairies and hunted for sport, while the inquisitive draenei built crude cities within the world's towering cliffs and peaks. Kil'jaeden knew that Draenor's denizens had great potential to serve the Burning Legion if they could be cultivated properly.

[page 1946]
next_page=1947
text=Of the two races, Kil'jaeden saw that the warrior orcs were more susceptible to the Legion's corruption. He enthralled the elder orc shaman, Ner'zhul, in much the same way that Sargeras brought Queen Azshara under his control in ages past. Using the cunning shaman as his conduit, the demon spread battle lust and savagery throughout the orc clans.

[page 1947]
next_page=1948
text=Before long, the spiritual race was transformed into a bloodthirsty people. Kil'jaeden then urged Ner'zhul and his people to take the last step: to give themselves over entirely to the pursuit of death and war. Yet the old shaman, sensing that his people would be enslaved to hatred forever, somehow resisted the demon's command.

[page 1948]
next_page=1949
text=Frustrated by Ner'zhul's resistance, Kil'jaeden searched for another orc who would deliver his people into the Legion's hands. The clever demonlord finally found the willing disciple he sought - Ner'zhul's ambitious apprentice, Gul'dan. Kil'jaeden promised Gul'dan untold power in exchange for his utter obedience.

[page 1949]
next_page=1950
text=The young orc became an avid student of demonic magic and developed into the most powerful mortal warlock in history. He taught other young orcs the arcane arts and strove to eradicate the orcs' shamanistic traditions. Gul'dan showed a new brand of magic to his brethren, a terrible new power that reeked of doom.

[page 1950]
text=Kil'jaeden, seeking to tighten his hold over the orcs, helped Gul'dan found the Shadow Council, a secretive sect that manipulated the clans and spread the use of warlock magics throughout Draenor. As more and more orcs began to wield warlock magics, the gentle fields and streams of Draenor began to blacken and fade. Over time, the vast prairies the orcs had called home for generations withered away, leaving only red barren soil. The demon energies were slowly killing the world.

[page 1951]
next_page=1952
text=The orcs became increasingly aggressive under the secret control of Gul'dan and his Shadow Council. They constructed massive arenas where the orcs honed their warrior skills in trials of combat and death. During this period, a few clan chieftains spoke out against the growing depravity in their race.

[page 1952]
next_page=1953
text=One such chieftain, Durotan of the Frostwolf clan, warned against the orcs' losing themselves to hate and fury. His words fell on deaf ears, however, as stronger chieftains such as Grom Hellscream of the Warsong clan stepped forward to champion the new age of warfare and dominance.

[page 1953]
next_page=1954
text=Kil'jaeden knew that the orc clans were almost ready, but he needed to be certain of their ultimate loyalty. In secret, he had the Shadow Council summon Mannoroth the Destructor, the living vessel of destruction and rage. Gul'dan called the clan chieftains together and convinced them that drinking Mannoroth's raging blood would make them utterly invincible.
text=

[page 1954]
next_page=1955
text= Led by Grom Hellscream, all the clan chiefs except Durotan drank and thereby sealed their fates as slaves to the Burning Legion. Empowered by Mannoroth's rage, the chieftains unwittingly extended this subjugation to their unsuspecting brethren.

[page 1955]
next_page=1956
text=Consumed with the curse of this new bloodlust, the orcs sought to unleash their fury on any who stood before them. Sensing that the time had come, Gul'dan united the warring clans into a single unstoppable Horde.

[page 1956]
next_page=1957
text=However, knowing that the various chieftains like Hellscream and Orgrim Doomhammer would vie for overall supremacy, Gul'dan set up a puppet warchief to rule over this new Horde. Blackhand the Destroyer, a particularly depraved and vicious orc warlord, was chosen to be Gul'dan's puppet. Under Blackhand's command, the Horde set out to test itself against the simple draenei.

[page 1957]
next_page=1958
text=Over the course of a few months, the Horde eradicated nearly every draenei living on Draenor. Only a scattered handful of survivors managed to evade the orcs' awesome wrath. Flushed with victory, Gul'dan reveled in the Horde's power and might. Still, he knew that without any enemies to fight, the Horde would consume itself with endless infighting in its unstoppable appetite for glorious slaughter.

[page 1958]
text=Kil'jaeden knew that the Horde was finally prepared. The orcs had become the Burning Legion's greatest weapon. The cunning demon shared his knowledge with his waiting master, and Sargeras agreed that the time of his revenge had finally come.

[page 1959]
next_page=1960
text=As Kil'jaeden prepared the Horde for its invasion of Azeroth, Medivh continued to fight for his soul against Sargeras. King Llane, the noble monarch of Stormwind, grew wary of the darkness which seemed to taint the spirit of his former friend.

[page 1960]
next_page=1961
text=King Llane shared his concerns with Anduin Lothar, the last descendent of the Arathi bloodline, whom he named his lieutenant-at-arms. Even so, neither man could have imagined that Medivh's slow descent into madness would bring about the horrors that were to come.

[page 1961]
next_page=1962
text=As a final incentive, Sargeras promised to bestow great power upon Gul'dan if he agreed to lead the Horde to Azeroth. Through Medivh, Sargeras told the warlock that he could become a living god if he found the undersea tomb where the Guardian Aegwynn had placed Sargeras' crippled body nearly a thousand years before.

[page 1962]
next_page=1963
text= Gul'dan agreed and decided that once the denizens of Azeroth were beaten, he would find the legendary tomb and claim his reward. Assured that the Horde would serve his purposes, Sargeras ordered the invasion to begin.

[page 1963]
next_page=1964
text=Through a joint effort, Medivh and the warlocks of the Shadow Council opened the dimensional gateway known as the Dark Portal. This portal bridged the distance between Azeroth and Draenor, and it was large enough that armies might pass through it. Gul'dan dispatched orc scouts through the portal to survey the lands which they would conquer. The returning scouts assured the Shadow Council that the world of Azeroth was ripe for the taking.

[page 1964]
next_page=1965
text=Still convinced that Gul'dan's corruption would destroy his people, Durotan spoke out against the warlocks once more. The brave warrior claimed that warlocks were destroying the purity of the orcish spirit and that this reckless invasion would be their doom. Gul'dan, unable to risk killing such a popular hero, was forced to exile Durotan and his Frostwolf Clan into the far reaches of this new world.

[page 1965]
next_page=1966
text=After the exiled Frostwolves charged through the portal, only a few orc clans followed. These orcs quickly set up a base of operations within the Black Morass, a dark and swampy area far to the east of the kingdom of Stormwind. As the orcs began to branch out and explore the new lands, they came into immediate conflict with the human defenders of Stormwind.
text=

[page 1966]
next_page=1967
text=Though these skirmishes usually ended quickly, they did much to illustrate the weaknesses and strengths of both rival species. Llane and Lothar were never able to gather accurate data of the orcs' numbers and could only guess at how great a force they would have to contend with.

[page 1967]
next_page=1968
text=After a few years the majority of the orcish Horde had crossed into Azeroth, and Gul'dan deemed that the time for the primary strike against humanity had come. The Horde launched its full might against the unsuspecting kingdom of Stormwind.

[page 1968]
next_page=1969
text=As the forces of Azeroth and the Horde clashed across the kingdom, internal conflicts began to take their toll on both armies. King Llane, who believed the bestial orcs to be incapable of conquering Azeroth, contemptuously held his position at his capital of Stormwind. However, Sir Lothar became convinced that the battle should be taken directly to the enemy, and he was forced to choose between his convictions and his loyalty to the king.

[page 1969]
next_page=1970
text=Choosing to follow his instincts, Lothar stormed Medivh's tower-fortress of Karazhan with the help of the wizard's young apprentice, Khadgar. Khadgar and Lothar succeeded in vanquishing the possessed Guardian, whom they confirmed to be the source of the conflict.

[page 1970]
next_page=1971
text=By killing Medivh's body, Lothar and the young apprentice inadvertently banished the spirit of Sargeras to the abyss. As a consequence, the pure, virtuous spirit of Medivh was also allowed to live on... and wander the astral plane for many years to come.

[page 1971]
next_page=1972
text=Although Medivh had been defeated, the Horde continued to dominate the defenders of Stormwind. As the Horde's victory drew nearer, Orgrim Doomhammer, one of the greatest orc chieftains, began to see the depraved corruption that had spread throughout the clans since their time in Draenor.

[page 1972]
next_page=1973
text=His old comrade, Durotan, returned from exile and warned him yet again of Gul'dan's treachery. In speedy retribution, Gul'dan's assassins murdered Durotan and his family, leaving only his infant son alive. Unknown to Doomhammer was the fact that Durotan's infant son was found by the human officer, Aedelas Blackmoore, and taken as a slave.
text=
text=That infant orc would one day rise to become the greatest leader his people would ever know.

[page 1973]
next_page=1974
text=Incensed by Durotan's death, Orgrim set out to free the Horde from demonic corruption and ultimately assumed the role of warchief of the Horde by killing Gul'dan's corrupt puppet, Blackhand. Under his decisive leadership the relentless Horde finally laid siege to Stormwind Keep.

[page 1974]
next_page=1975
text=King Llane had severely underestimated the might of the Horde, and he watched helplessly as his kingdom fell to the green-skinned invaders. Ultimately King Llane was assassinated by one of the Shadow Council's finest killers: the half-orc, Garona.

[page 1975]
text=Lothar and his warriors, returning home from Karazhan, hoped to stem the loss of life and save their once-glorious homeland. Instead, they returned too late and found their beloved kingdom in smoking ruins. The orcish Horde continued to ravage the countryside and claimed the surrounding lands for its own. Forced into hiding, Lothar and his companions swore a grim oath to reclaim their homeland at any cost.

[page 1976]
next_page=1977
text=Lord Lothar rallied the remnants of Azeroth's armies after their defeat at Stormwind Keep, and then launched a massive exodus across the sea to the northern kingdom of Lordaeron. Convinced that the Horde would overcome all of humanity if left unchecked, the leaders of the seven human nations met and agreed to unite in what would become known as the Alliance of Lordaeron.

[page 1977]
next_page=1978
text=For the first time in nearly three thousand years, the disparate nations of Arathor were once again united under a common banner. Appointed as Supreme Commander of the Alliance forces, Lord Lothar prepared his armies for the coming of the Horde.

[page 1978]
next_page=1979
text=Aided by his lieutenants, Uther the Lightbringer, Admiral Daelin Proudmoore, and Turalyon, Lothar was able to convince Lordaeron's demi-human races of the impending threat as well. The Alliance succeeded in gaining the support of the stoic dwarves of Ironforge and a small number of high elves of Quel'Thalas.

[page 1979]
next_page=1980
text=The elves, led at that time by Anasterian Sunstrider, were largely uninterested in the coming conflict. However, they were duty-bound to aid Lothar because he was the last descendent of the Arathi bloodline, which had aided the elves in ages past.

[page 1980]
next_page=1981
text=The Horde, now led by Warchief Doomhammer, brought in ogres from its homeworld of Draenor and conscripted the disenfranchised Amani forest trolls into its fold. Setting out on a massive campaign to overrun the dwarf kingdom of Khaz Modan and the southern reaches of Lordaeron, the Horde effortlessly decimated all opposition.

[page 1981]
next_page=1982
text=The epic battles of the Second War ranged from large-scale naval skirmishes to massive aerial dogfights. Somehow the Horde had unearthed a powerful artifact known as the Demon Soul and used it to enslave the ancient Dragonqueen, Alexstrasza. Threatening to destroy her precious eggs, the Horde forced Alexstrasza to send her grown children to war. The noble red dragons were forced to fight for the Horde, and fight they did.

[page 1982]
next_page=1983
text=The war raged across the continents of Khaz Modan, Lordaeron, and Azeroth itself. As part of its northern campaign, the Horde succeeded in burning down the borderlands of Quel'Thalas, thereby ensuring the elves' final commitment to the Alliance's cause. The greater cities and townships of Lordaeron were razed and devastated by the conflict. Despite the absence of reinforcements and overwhelming odds, Lothar and his allies succeeded in holding their enemies at bay.

[page 1983]
next_page=1984
text=However, during the final days of the Second War, as the Horde's victory over the Alliance seemed almost assured, a terrible feud erupted between the two most powerful orcs on Azeroth. As Doomhammer prepared his final assault against the Capital City of Lordaeron - an assault that would have crushed the last remnants of the Alliance - Gul'dan and his followers abandoned their posts and set out to sea.

[page 1984]
next_page=1985
text=The bewildered Doomhammer, having lost nearly half of his standing forces to Gul'dan's treachery, was forced to pull back and forsake his greatest chance at victory over the Alliance.

[page 1985]
next_page=1986
text=The power-hungry Gul'dan, obsessed with obtaining godhood itself, set out on a desperate search for the undersea Tomb of Sargeras that he believed held the secrets of ultimate power. Having already doomed his fellow orcs to become the slaves of the Burning Legion, Gul'dan thought nothing of his supposed duty to Doomhammer.

[page 1986]
next_page=1987
text=Backed by the Stormreaver and Twilight's Hammer clans, Gul'dan succeeded in raising the Tomb of Sargeras from the sea floor. However, when he opened the ancient, flooded vault, he found only crazed demons awaiting him.

[page 1987]
next_page=1988
text=Seeking to punish the wayward orcs for their costly betrayal, Doomhammer sent his forces to kill Gul'dan and bring the renegades back into the fold. For his recklessness, Gul'dan was torn apart by the maddened demons he had set loose. With their leader dead, the renegade clans quickly fell before Doomhammer's enraged legions.

[page 1988]
next_page=1989
text=Though the rebellion had been quelled, the Horde was unable to recoup the terrible losses it had suffered. Gul'dan's betrayal had afforded the Alliance not only hope, but also time to regroup and retaliate.

[page 1989]
next_page=1990
text=Lord Lothar, seeing that the Horde was fracturing from within, gathered the last of his forces and pushed Doomhammer south, back into the shattered heartland of Stormwind. There, the Alliance forces trapped the retreating Horde within the volcanic fortress of Blackrock Spire. Though Lord Lothar fell in battle at the Spire's base, his lieutenant, Turalyon, rallied the Alliance forces at the eleventh hour and drove the Horde back into the abysmal Swamp of Sorrows.

[page 1990]
next_page=1991
text=Turalyon's forces succeeded in destroying the Dark Portal, the mystical gateway that connected the orcs to their homeworld of Draenor. Cut off from its reinforcements and fractured by infighting, the Horde finally buckled in upon itself and fell before the might of the Alliance.

[page 1991]
text=The scattered orc clans were quickly rounded up and placed within guarded internment camps. Though it seemed that the Horde had been defeated for good, some remained highly skeptical that peace would last. Khadgar, now an Archmage of some renown, convinced the Alliance high command to build the fortress of Nethergarde that would watch over the ruins of the Dark Portal and ensure that there would be no further invasions from Draenor.

[page 2002]
next_page=2003
text=Ner'zhul and his followers entered the Twisting Nether, the ethereal plane that connects all of the worlds scattered throughout the Great Dark Beyond. Unfortunately Kil'jaeden and his demonic minions were waiting for them. Kil'jaeden, who had sworn to take vengeance on Ner'zhul for his prideful defiance, slowly tore the old shaman's body apart, piece by piece.

[page 2003]
next_page=2004
text=Kil'jaeden kept the shaman's spirit alive and intact, thus leaving Ner'zhul painfully aware of his body's gross dismemberment. Though Ner'zhul pleaded with the demon to release his spirit and grant him death, the demon grimly replied that the Blood Pact they had made long ago was still binding, and that Ner'zhul still had a purpose to serve.

[page 2004]
next_page=2005
text=The orcs' failure to conquer the world for the Burning Legion forced Kil'jaeden to create a new army to sew chaos throughout the kingdoms of the Azeroth. This new army could not be allowed to fall prey to the same petty rivalries and infighting that had plagued the Horde. It would have to be merciless and single-minded in its mission. This time, Kil'jaeden could not afford to fail.

[page 2005]
next_page=2006
text=Holding Ner'zhul's spirit helpless in stasis, Kil'jaeden gave him one last chance to serve the Legion or suffer eternal torment. Once again, Ner'zhul recklessly agreed to the demon's pact. Ner'zhul's spirit was placed within a specially crafted block of diamond-hard ice gathered from the far reaches of the Twisting Nether.

[page 2006]
next_page=2007
text=Encased within the frozen cask, Ner'zhul felt his consciousness expand ten thousand-fold. Warped by the demon's chaotic powers, Ner'zhul became a spectral being of unfathomable power. At that moment, the orc known as Ner'zhul was shattered forever, and the Lich King was born.

[page 2007]
next_page=2008
text=Ner'zhul's loyal death knights and Shadowmoon followers were also transformed by the demon's chaotic energies. The wicked spellcasters were ripped apart and remade as skeletal liches. The demons had ensured that even in death, Ner'zhul's followers would serve him unquestioningly.

[page 2008]
next_page=2009
text=When the time was right, Kil'jaeden explained the mission for which he had created the Lich King. Ner'zhul was to spread a plague of death and terror across Azeroth that would snuff out human civilization forever. All those who died from the dreaded plague would arise as the undead, and their spirits would be bound to Ner'zhul's iron will forever.

[page 2009]
next_page=2010
text= Kil'jaeden promised that if Ner'zhul accomplished his dark mission of scouring humanity from the world, he would be freed from his curse and granted a new, healthy body to inhabit.

[page 2010]
next_page=2011
text=Though Ner'zhul was agreeable and seemingly anxious to play his part, Kil'jaeden remained skeptical of his pawn's loyalties. Keeping the Lich King bodiless and trapped within the crystal cask assured his good conduct for the short term, but the demon knew that he would need to keep a watchful eye on him. To this end, Kil'jaeden called upon his elite demon guard, the vampiric dreadlords, to police Ner'zhul and ensure that he accomplished his dread task.

[page 2011]
text=Tichondrius, the most powerful and cunning of the dreadlords, warmed to the challenge; he was fascinated by the plague's severity and the Lich King's unbridled potential for genocide.

[page 2012]
next_page=2013
text=Kil'jaeden cast Ner'zhul's icy cask back into the world of Azeroth. The hardened crystal streaked across the night sky and smashed into the desolate arctic continent of Northrend, burying itself deep within the Icecrown glacier. The frozen crystal, warped and scarred by its violent descent, came to resemble a throne, and Ner'zhul's vengeful spirit soon stirred within it.
text=

[page 2013]
next_page=2014
text=From the confines of the Frozen Throne, Ner'zhul began to reach out his vast consciousness and touch the minds of Northrend's native inhabitants. With little effort, he enslaved the minds of many indigenous creatures, including ice trolls and fierce wendigo, and he drew their evil brethren into his growing shadow. His psychic powers proved to be almost limitless, and he used them to create a small army that he housed within Icecrown's twisting labyrinths.

[page 2014]
next_page=2015
text=As the Lich King mastered his growing abilities under the dreadlords' persistent vigil, he discovered a remote human settlement on the fringe of the vast Dragonblight. On a whim, Ner'zhul decided to test his powers on the unsuspecting humans.

[page 2015]
next_page=2016
text=Ner'zhul cast a plague of undeath - which had originated from deep within the Frozen Throne, out into the arctic wasteland. Controlling the plague with his will alone, he drove it straight into the human village. Within three days, everyone in the settlement was dead, but shortly thereafter, the dead villagers began to rise as zombified corpses. Ner'zhul could feel their individual spirits and thoughts as if they were his own.

[page 2016]
next_page=2017
text=The raging cacophony in his mind caused Ner'zhul to grow even more powerful, as if their spirits provided him with much-needed nourishment. He found it was child's play to control the zombies' actions and steer them to whatever end he wished.

[page 2017]
text=Over the following months, Ner'zhul continued to experiment with his plague of undeath by subjugating every human inhabitant of Northrend. With his army of undead growing daily, he knew that the time for his true test was nearing.

[page 2018]
next_page=2019
text=Meanwhile, in the war-torn lands of the south, the scattered remnants of the Horde fought for their very survival. Though Grom Hellscream and his Warsong clan managed to evade capture, Deadeye and his Bleeding Hollow clan were rounded up and placed in the internment camps in Lordaeron. Notwithstanding these costly uprisings, the camps' wardens soon re-established control over their brutish charges.

[page 2019]
next_page=2020
text=However, unknown to the Alliance, a large force of orcs still roamed free in the northern wastes of Khaz Modan. The Dragonmaw clan, led by the infamous warlock Nekros, was using an ancient artifact known as the Demon Soul to control the Dragonqueen, Alexstrasza, and her dragonflight. With the Dragonqueen as his hostage, Nekros built up a secret army within the abandoned - some say cursed - Wildhammer stronghold of Grim Batol.

[page 2020]
next_page=2021
text=Planning to unleash his forces and the mighty red dragons on the Alliance, Nekros hoped to reunite the Horde and continue its conquest of Azeroth. His vision did not come to pass: a small group of resistance fighters, led by the human mage Rhonin managed to destroy the Demon Soul and free the Dragonqueen from Nekros' command.

[page 2021]
text=In their fury, Alexstrasza's dragons tore Grim Batol apart and incinerated the greater bulk of the Dragonmaw clan. Nekros' grand schemes of reunification came crashing down as the Alliance troops rounded up the remaining orc survivors and threw them into the waiting internment camps. The Dragonmaw clan's defeat signaled the end of the Horde, and the end of the orcs' furious bloodlust.

[page 2022]
next_page=2023
text=Months passed, and more orc prisoners were rounded up and placed within the internment camps. As the camps began to overflow, the Alliance was forced to construct new camps in the plains south of the Alterac Mountains. To properly maintain and supply the growing number of camps, King Terenas levied a new tax on the Alliance nations.

[page 2023]
next_page=2024
text=This tax, along with increased political tensions over border disputes, created widespread unrest. It seemed that the fragile pact that had forged the human nations together in their darkest hour would break at any given moment.

[page 2024]
next_page=2025
text=Amidst the political turmoil, many of the camp wardens began to notice an unsettling change come over their orc captives. The orcs' efforts to escape from the camps or even fight amongst themselves had greatly decreased in frequency over time. The orcs were becoming increasingly aloof and lethargic.

[page 2025]
next_page=2026
text= Though it was difficult to believe, the orcs - once held as the most aggressive race ever seen on Azeroth - had completely lost their will to fight. The strange lethargy confounded the Alliance leaders and continued to take its toll on the rapidly weakening orcs.

[page 2026]
next_page=2027
text=Some speculated that some strange disease, contractible only by orcs, brought about the baffling lethargy. But Archmage Antonidas of Dalaran posed a different hypothesis. Researching what little he could find of orcish history, Antonidas learned that the orcs had been under the crippling influence of demonic power for generations.

[page 2027]
next_page=2028
text= He speculated that the orcs had been corrupted by these powers even before their first invasion of Azeroth. Clearly, demons had spiked the orcs' blood, and in turn the brutes had been granted unnaturally heightened strength, endurance, and aggression.

[page 2028]
next_page=2029
text=Antonidas theorized that the orcs' communal lethargy was not actually a disease, but a consequence of racial withdrawal from the volatile warlock magics that had made them fearsome, bloodlusted warriors.

[page 2029]
text=Though the symptoms were clear, Antonidas was unable to find a cure for the orcs' present condition. Then too, many of his fellow mages, as well as a few notable Alliance leaders, argued that finding a cure for the orcs would be an imprudent venture. Left to ponder the orcs' mysterious condition, Antonidas' conclusion was that the orcs' cure would have to be a spiritual one.

[page 2030]
next_page=2031
text=The chief warden of the internment camps, Aedelas Blackmoore, watched over the captive orcs from his prison-stronghold, Durnholde. One orc in particular had always held his interest: the orphaned infant he had found nearly eighteen years before. Blackmoore had raised the young male as a favored slave and named him Thrall. Blackmoore taught the orc about tactics, philosophy, and combat. Thrall was even trained as a gladiator. All the while, the corrupt warden sought to mold the orc into a weapon.

[page 2031]
next_page=2032
text=Despite his harsh upbringing, young Thrall grew into a strong, quick-witted orc, and he knew in his heart that a slave's life was not for him. As he grew to maturity, he learned about his people, the orcs, whom he had never met: after their defeat, most of them had been placed in internment camps. Rumor had it that Doomhammer, the orc leader, had escaped from Lordaeron and gone into hiding. Only one rogue clan still operated in secret, trying to evade the watchful eyes of the Alliance.

[page 2032]
next_page=2033
text=The resourceful yet inexperienced Thrall decided to escape from Blackmoore's fortress and set off to find others of his kind. During his journeys Thrall visited the internment camps and found his once-mighty race to be strangely cowed and lethargic. Having not found the proud warriors he hoped to discover, Thrall set out to find the last undefeated orc chieftain, Grom Hellscream.

[page 2033]
next_page=2034
text=Constantly hunted by the humans, Hellscream nevertheless held onto the Horde's unquenchable will to fight. Aided only by his own devoted Warsong clan, Hellscream continued to wage an underground war against the oppression of his beleaguered people. Unfortunately, Hellscream could never find a way to rouse the captured orcs from their stupor. The impressionable Thrall, inspired by Hellscream's idealism, developed a strong empathy for the Horde and its warrior traditions.

[page 2034]
next_page=2035
text=Seeking the truth of his own origins, Thrall traveled north to find the legendary Frostwolf clan. Thrall learned that Gul'dan had exiled the Frostwolves during the early days of the First War. He also discovered that he was the son and heir of the orc hero Durotan, the true chieftain of the Frostwolves who had been murdered in the wilds nearly twenty years before.

[page 2035]
next_page=2036
text=Under the tutelage of the venerable shaman Drek'Thar, Thrall studied his people's ancient shamanistic culture, which had been forgotten under Gul'dan's evil rule. Over time, Thrall became a powerful shaman and took his rightful place as chieftain of the exiled Frostwolves. Empowered by the elements themselves and driven to find his destiny, Thrall set off to free the captive clans and heal his race of demonic corruption.

[page 2036]
next_page=2037
text=During his travels, Thrall found the aged warchief, Orgrim Doomhammer, who had been living as a hermit for many years. Doomhammer, who had been a close friend of Thrall's father, decided to follow the young, visionary orc and help him free the captive clans. Supported by many of the veteran chieftains, Thrall ultimately succeeded in revitalizing the Horde and giving his people a new spiritual identity.

[page 2037]
next_page=2038
text=To symbolize his people's rebirth, Thrall returned to Blackmoore's fortress of Durnholde and put a decisive end to his former master's plans by laying siege to the internment camps. This victory was not without its price: during the liberation of one camp, Doomhammer fell in battle.

[page 2038]
text=Thrall took up Doomhammer's legendary warhammer and donned his black plate-armor to become the new warchief of the Horde. During the following months, Thrall's small but volatile Horde laid waste to the internment camps and stymied the Alliance's best efforts to counter his clever strategies. Encouraged by his best friend and mentor, Grom Hellscream, Thrall worked to ensure that his people would never be slaves again.

[page 2039]
next_page=2040
text=While Thrall was liberating his brethren in Lordaeron, Ner'zhul continued to build up his power base in Northrend. A great citadel was erected above the Icecrown Glacier and manned by the growing legions of the dead. Yet as the Lich King extended his influence over the land, one shadowy empire stood against his power.

[page 2040]
next_page=2041
text=The ancient subterranean kingdom of Azjol-Nerub, which had been founded by a race of sinister humanoid spiders, sent their elite warrior-guard to attack Icecrown and end the Lich King's mad bid for dominance. Much to his frustration, Ner'zhul found that the evil nerubians were immune not only to the plague, but to his telepathic domination as well.

[page 2041]
next_page=2042
text=The nerubian spider-lords commanded vast forces and had an underground network that stretched nearly half the breadth of Northrend. Their hit-and-run tactics on the Lich King's strongholds stymied his efforts to root them out time after time. Ultimately Ner'zhul's war against the nerubians was won by attrition. With the aid of the sinister dreadlords and innumerable undead warriors, the Lich King invaded Azjol-Nerub and brought its subterranean temples crashing down upon the spider lords' heads.

[page 2042]
next_page=2043
text=Though the nerubians were immune to his plague, Ner'zhul's growing necromantic powers allowed him to raise the spider-warriors' corpses and bend them to his will. As a testament to their tenacity and fearlessness, Ner'zhul adopted the nerubians' distinctive architectural style for his own fortresses and structures.

[page 2043]
text=Left to rule his kingdom unopposed, the Lich King began preparing for his true mission in the world. Reaching out into the human lands with his vast consciousness, the Lich King called out to any dark soul that would listen....

[page 2044]
next_page=2045
text=There were a handful of powerful individuals scattered throughout the world who heard the Lich King's mental summons from Northrend. Most notable of them was the archmage of Dalaran, Kel'Thuzad, who was one of senior members of the Kirin Tor, Dalaran's ruling council. He had been considered a maverick for years due to his insistence on studying the forbidden arts of necromancy.

[page 2045]
next_page=2046
text=Driven to learn all he could of the magical world and its shadowy wonders, he was frustrated by what he saw as his peers' outmoded and unimaginative precepts. Upon hearing the powerful summons from Northrend, the archmage bent all of his considerable will to communing with the mysterious voice. Convinced that the Kirin Tor was too squeamish to seize the power and knowledge inherent in the dark arts, he resigned himself to learn what he could from the immensely powerful Lich King.

[page 2046]
next_page=2047
text=Leaving behind his fortune and prestigious political standing, Kel'Thuzad abandoned the ways of the Kirin Tor and left Dalaran forever. Prodded by the Lich King's persistent voice in his mind, he sold his vast holdings and stored away his fortunes. Traveling alone over many leagues of both land and sea, he finally reached the frozen shores of Northrend.

[page 2047]
next_page=2048
text=Intent on reaching Icecrown and offering his services to the Lich King, the archmage passed through the ravaged, war-torn ruins of Azjol-Nerub. Kel'Thuzad saw firsthand the scope and ferocity of Ner'zhul's power. He began to realize that allying himself with the mysterious Lich King might be both wise and potentially fruitful.

[page 2048]
next_page=2049
text=After long months of trekking through the harsh arctic wastelands, Kel'Thuzad finally reached the dark glacier of Icecrown. He boldly approached Ner'zhul's dark citadel and was shocked when the undead guardsmen silently let him pass as though he was expected.

[page 2049]
next_page=2050
text=Kel'Thuzad descended deep into the cold earth and found his way down to the bottom of the glacier. There, in the endless cavern of ice and shadows, he prostrated himself before the Frozen Throne and offered his soul to the dark lord of the dead.

[page 2050]
next_page=2051
text=The Lich King was pleased with his latest conscript. He promised Kel'Thuzad immortality and great power in exchange for his loyalty and obedience. Eager for dark knowledge and power, Kel'Thuzad accepted his first great mission: to go into the world of men and found a new religion that would worship the Lich King as a god.

[page 2051]
next_page=2052
text=To help the archmage accomplish his mission, Ner'zhul left Kel'Thuzad's humanity intact. The aged yet still charismatic wizard was charged with using his powers of illusion and persuasion to lull the downtrodden, disenfranchised masses of Lordaeron into a state of trust and belief. Then, once he had their attention, he would offer them a new vision of what society could be - and a new figurehead to call their king.

[page 2052]
next_page=2053
text=Kel'Thuzad returned to Lordaeron in disguise, and over the span of three years, he used his fortune and intellect to gather a clandestine brotherhood of like-minded men and women. The brotherhood, which he called the Cult of the Damned, promised its acolytes social equality and eternal life on Azeroth in exchange for their service and obedience to Ner'zhul.

[page 2053]
next_page=2054
text=As the months passed, Kel'Thuzad found many eager volunteers for his new cult amongst the tired, overburdened laborers of Lordaeron. It was surprisingly easy for Kel'Thuzad to achieve his goal: namely, to transfer the citizens' faith in the Holy Light into belief in Ner'zhul's dark shadow. As the Cult of the Damned grew in size and influence, Kel'Thuzad made sure to hide its workings from the authorities of Lordaeron.

[page 2054]
next_page=2055
text=With Kel'Thuzad's success in Lordaeron, the Lich King made the final preparations for his assault against human civilization. Placing his plague-energies into a number of portable artifacts called plague-cauldrons, Ner'zhul ordered Kel'Thuzad to transport the cauldrons to Lordaeron, where they would be hidden within various cult-controlled villages.

[page 2055]
next_page=2056
text=The cauldrons, protected by the loyal cultists, would then act as plague-generators, sending the plague seeping out across the unsuspecting farmlands and cities of northern Lordaeron.

[page 2056]
next_page=2057
text=The Lich King's plan worked perfectly. Many of Lordaeron's northern villages were contaminated almost immediately. Just as in Northrend, the citizens who contracted the plague died and arose as the Lich King's willing slaves.

[page 2057]
text=The cultists under Kel'Thuzad were eager to die and be raised again in their dark lord's service. They exulted in the prospect of immortality through undeath. As the plague spread, more and more feral zombies arose in the northlands. Kel'Thuzad looked upon the Lich King's growing army and named it the Scourge, for soon it would march upon the gates of Lordaeron and scour humanity from the face of the world.

[page 2064]
next_page=2065
text=After preparing for many long months, Kel'Thuzad and his Cult of the Damned finally struck the first blow by releasing the plague of undeath upon Lordaeron. Uther and his fellow paladins investigated the infected regions in the hope of finding a way to stop the plague. Despite their efforts, the plague continued to spread and threatened to tear the Alliance apart.

[page 2065]
next_page=2066
text=As the ranks of the undead swept across Lordaeron, Terenas' only son, Prince Arthas, took up the fight against the Scourge. Arthas succeeded in killing Kel'Thuzad, but even so, the undead ranks swelled with every soldier that fell defending the land. Frustrated and stymied by the seemingly unstoppable enemy, Arthas took increasingly extreme steps to conquer them. Finally Arthas' comrades warned him that he was losing his hold on his humanity.

[page 2066]
next_page=2067
text=Arthas' fear and resolve proved to be his ultimate undoing. He tracked the plague's source to Northrend, intending to end its threat forever. Instead, Prince Arthas eventually fell prey to the Lich King's tremendous power. Believing that it would save his people, Arthas took up the cursed runeblade, Frostmourne.

[page 2067]
text=Though the sword did grant him unfathomable power, it also stole his soul and transformed him into the greatest of the Lich King's death knights. With his soul cast aside and his sanity shattered, Arthas led the Scourge against his own kingdom. Ultimately, Arthas murdered his own father, King Terenas, and crushed Lordaeron under the Lich King's iron heel.

[page 2068]
next_page=2069
text=Though he had defeated all of the people he now saw as his enemies, Arthas was still haunted by the ghost of Kel'Thuzad. The ghost told Arthas that he needed to be revived for the next phase of the Lich King's plan. To revive him, Arthas needed to bring Kel'Thuzad's remains to the mystical Sunwell, hidden within the high elves' eternal kingdom of Quel'Thalas.

[page 2069]
next_page=2070
text=Arthas and his Scourge invaded Quel'Thalas and laid siege to the elves' crumbling defenses. Sylvanas Windrunner, the Ranger-General of Silvermoon, put up a valiant fight, but Arthas eventually eradicated the high elf army and battled through to the Sunwell. In a cruel gesture of his dominance, he even raised Sylvanas' defeated body as a banshee, cursed to endless undeath in the service of Quel'Thalas' conqueror.

[page 2070]
next_page=2071
text=Ultimately, Arthas submerged Kel'Thuzad's remains within the holy waters of the Sunwell. Although the potent waters of Eternity were fouled by this act, Kel'Thuzad was reborn as a sorcerous lich. Resurrected as a far more powerful being, Kel'Thuzad explained the next phase of the Lich King's plan.

[page 2071]
text=By the time Arthas and his army of the dead turned southward, not one living elf remained in Quel'Thalas. The glorious homeland of the high elves, which had stood for more than nine thousand years, was no more.

[page 2072]
next_page=2073
text=Once Kel'Thuzad was whole again, Arthas led the Scourge south to Dalaran. There the lich would obtain the powerful spellbook of Medivh, and use it to summon Archimonde back into the world. From that point on, Archimonde himself would begin the Legion's final invasion. Not even the wizards of the Kirin Tor could stop Arthas' forces from stealing Medivh's book, and soon Kel'Thuzad had all he needed to perform his spell.

[page 2073]
next_page=2074
text=After ten thousand years, the mighty demon Archimonde and his host emerged once again upon the world of Azeroth. Yet Dalaran was not their final destination. Under orders from Kil'jaeden himself, Archimonde and his demons followed the undead Scourge to Kalimdor, bent on destroying Nordrassil, the World Tree.

[page 2074]
next_page=2075
text=In the midst of this chaos, a lone, mysterious prophet appeared to lend the mortal races guidance. This prophet proved to be none other than Medivh, the last Guardian, miraculously returned from the Beyond to redeem himself for past sins. Medivh told the Horde and the Alliance of the dangers they faced and urged them to band together.

[page 2075]
next_page=2076
text=Jaded by generations of hate, the orcs and humans would have none of it. Medivh was forced to deal with each race separately, using prophecy and trickery to guide them across the sea to the legendary land of Kalimdor. The orcs and humans soon encountered the long-hidden civilization of the Kaldorei.

[page 2076]
next_page=2077
text=The orcs, led by Thrall, suffered a series of setbacks on their journey across Kalimdor's Barrens. Though they befriended Cairne Bloodhoof and his mighty tauren warriors, many orcs began to succumb to the demonic bloodlust that had plagued them for years. Thrall's greatest lieutenant, Grom Hellscream, even betrayed the Horde by giving himself over to his baser instincts.

[page 2077]
next_page=2078
text= As Hellscream and his loyal Warsong warriors stalked through the forests of Ashenvale, they clashed with the ancient night elf Sentinels. Certain that the orcs had returned to their warlike ways, the demigod Cenarius came forth to drive Hellscream and his orcs back. Yet Hellscream and his orcs, overcome with supernatural hate and rage, managed to kill Cenarius and corrupt the ancient forestlands.

[page 2078]
next_page=2079
text=Ultimately, Hellscream redeemed his honor by helping Thrall defeat Mannoroth, the demon lord who first cursed the orcs with his bloodline of hate and rage. With Mannoroth's death, the orcs' blood-curse was finally brought to an end.

[page 2079]
next_page=2080
text=While Medivh worked to convince the orcs and humans of the need for an alliance, the night elves fought the Legion in their own secretive ways. Tyrande Whisperwind, the immortal High Priestess of the night elf Sentinels, battled desperately to keep the demons and undead from overrunning the forests of Ashenvale. Tyrande realized that she needed help, so she set out to awaken the night elf druids from their thousand-year slumber.

[page 2080]
next_page=2081
text=Calling upon her ancient love, Malfurion Stormrage, Tyrande succeeded in galvanizing her defenses and driving the Legion back. With Malfurion's help, nature herself rose up to vanquish the Legion and its Scourge allies.

[page 2081]
next_page=2082
text=While searching for more of the hibernating druids, Malfurion found the ancient barrow prison in which he had chained his brother, Illidan. Convinced that Illidan would aid them against the Legion, Tyrande set him free. Though Illidan did aid them for a time, he eventually fled to pursue his own interests.

[page 2082]
text=The night elves braced themselves and fought the Burning Legion with grim determination. The Legion had never ceased in its desire for the Well of Eternity, long the source of strength for the World Tree and itself the heart of the night elf kingdom. If their planned assault on the Tree was successful, the demons would literally tear the world apart.

[page 2083]
next_page=2084
text=During the Legion's invasion of Ashenvale, Illidan was released from his barrow prison after ten thousand years of captivity. Though he sought to appease his comrades, he soon reverted to true form and consumed the energies of a powerful warlock artifact known as the Skull of Gul'dan.

[page 2084]
next_page=2085
text=By doing so, Illidan developed demonic features and vastly magnified power. He also gained some of Gul'dan's old memories - especially those of the Tomb of Sargeras, the island dungeon rumored to hold the remains of the Dark Titan, Sargeras.

[page 2085]
next_page=2086
text=Bristling with power and free to roam the world once more, Illidan set out to find his own place in the great scheme of things. However, Kil'jaeden confronted Illidan and made him an offer he could not refuse. Kil'jaeden was angered by Archimonde's defeat at Mount Hyjal, but he had greater concerns than vengeance.

[page 2086]
next_page=2087
text=Sensing that his creation, the Lich King, was growing too powerful to control, Kil'jaeden ordered Illidan to destroy Ner'zhul and put an end to the undead Scourge once and for all. In exchange, Illidan would receive untold power and a true place amongst the remaining lords of the Burning Legion.

text=Illidan agreed and immediately set out to destroy the Frozen Throne, the icy crystal cask in which the Lich King's spirit resided. Illidan knew that he would need a mighty artifact to destroy the Frozen Throne. Using the knowledge he had gained from Gul'dan's memories, Illidan decided to seek out the Tomb of Sargeras and claim the Dark Titan's remains.

[page 2088]
next_page=2089
text=He called in some old Highborne debts and lured the serpentine naga from their dark undersea lairs. Led by the cunning witch Lady Vashj the naga helped Illidan reach the Broken Isles, where Sargeras' Tomb was rumored to be located.

[page 2089]
next_page=2090
text=As Illidan set out with the naga, Warden Maiev Shadowsong began to hunt him. Maiev had been Illidan's jailor for ten thousand years and relished the prospect of recapturing him. However, Illidan outsmarted Maiev and her Watchers and succeeded in claiming the Eye of Sargeras despite their efforts. With the powerful Eye in his possession, Illidan traveled to the former wizard-city of Dalaran.

[page 2090]
next_page=2091
text=Strengthened by the city's ley power lines, Illidan used the Eye to cast a destructive spell against the Lich King's citadel of Icecrown in distant Northrend. Illidan's attack shattered the Lich King's defenses and ruptured the very roof of the world. At the final moment, Illidan's destructive spell was stopped when his brother Malfurion and the Priestess Tyrande arrived to aid Maiev.

[page 2091]
next_page=2092
text=Knowing that Kil'jaeden would not be pleased with his failure to destroy the Frozen Throne, Illidan fled to the barren dimension known as Outland: the last remnants of Draenor, the orcs' former homeworld. There he planned to evade Kil'jaeden's wrath and plan his next moves.

[page 2092]
text=After they succeeded in stopping Illidan, Malfurion and Tyrande returned home to Ashenvale Forest to watch over their people. Maiev, however, would not quit so easily, and followed Illidan to Outland, determined to bring him to justice.

[page 2093]
next_page=2094
text=At this time, the undead Scourge had essentially transformed Lordaeron and Quel'Thalas into the toxic Plaguelands. There were only a few pockets of Alliance resistance forces left. One such group, consisting primarily of high elves, was led by the last of the Sunstrider dynasty: Prince Kael'thas.

[page 2094]
next_page=2095
text=Kael, an accomplished wizard himself, grew wary of the failing Alliance. The high elves grieved for the loss of their homeland and decided to call themselves blood elves in honor of their fallen people. Yet as they worked to keep the Scourge at bay, they suffered greatly at being cut off from the Sunwell that had empowered them.

[page 2095]
next_page=2096
text=Desperate to find a cure for his people's racial addiction to magic, Kael did the unthinkable: he embraced his people's Highborne ancestry and joined with Illidan and his naga in hopes of finding a new magical power source upon which to feed. The remaining Alliance commanders condemned the blood elves as traitors and cast them out for good.

[page 2096]
text=With no place left to go, Kael and his blood elves followed Lady Vashj to Outland to help contest the warden, Maiev, who had recaptured Illidan. With the combined naga and blood elf forces, they managed to defeat Maiev and free Illidan from her grasp. Based in Outland, Illidan gathered his forces for a second strike against the Lich King and his fortress of Icecrown.

[page 2097]
next_page=2098
text=Ner'zhul, the Lich King, knew that his time was short. Imprisoned within the Frozen Throne, he suspected that Kil'jaeden would send his agents to destroy him. The damage caused by Illidan's spell had ruptured the Frozen Throne; thus, the Lich King was losing his power daily. Desperate to save himself, he called his greatest mortal servant to his side: the death knight Prince Arthas.

[page 2098]
next_page=2099
text=Though his powers were drained by the Lich King's weakness, Arthas had been involved in a civil war in Lordaeron. Half of the standing undead forces, led by the banshee Sylvanas Windrunner, staged a coup for control over the undead empire. Arthas, called by the Lich King, was forced to leave the Scourge in the hands of his lieutenant, Kel'Thuzad, as the war escalated throughout the Plaguelands.

[page 2099]
next_page=2100
text=Ultimately, Sylvanas and her rebel undead (known as the Forsaken) claimed the ruined capital city of Lordaeron as their own. Constructing their own bastion beneath the wrecked city, the Forsaken vowed to defeat the Scourge and drive Kel'Thuzad and his minions from the land.

[page 2100]
text=Weakened, but determined to save his master, Arthas reached Northrend only to find Illidan's naga and blood elves waiting for him. He and his nerubian allies raced against Illidan's forces to reach the Icecrown Glacier and defend the Frozen Throne.

[page 2101]
next_page=2102
text=Even weakened as he was, Arthas ultimately outmaneuvered Illidan and reached the Frozen Throne first. Using his runeblade, Frostmourne, Arthas shattered the Lich King's icy prison and thereby released Ner'zhul's enchanted helm and breastplate.

[page 2102]
next_page=2103
text=Arthas placed the unimaginably powerful helm on his head and became the new Lich King. Ner'zhul and Arthas' spirits fused into a single mighty being, just as Ner'zhul had always planned. Illidan and his troops were forced to flee back to Outland in disgrace, while Arthas became one of the most powerful entities the world had ever known.

[page 2103]
text=Currently Arthas, the new and immortal Lich King, resides in Northrend; he is rumored to be rebuilding the citadel of Icecrown. His trusted lieutenant, Kel'Thuzad, commands the Scourge in the Plaguelands. Sylvanas and her rebel Forsaken hold only the Tirisfal Glades, a small portion of the war-torn kingdom.

[page 2104]
next_page=2105
text=Though victory was theirs, the mortal races found themselves in a world shattered by war. The Scourge and the Burning Legion had all but destroyed the civilizations of Lordaeron, and had almost finished the job in Kalimdor. There were forests to heal, grudges to bury, and homelands to settle. The war had wounded each race deeply, but they had selflessly banded together to attempt a new beginning, starting with the uneasy truce between the Alliance and Horde.

[page 2105]
next_page=2106
text=Thrall led the orcs to the continent of Kalimdor, where they founded a new homeland with the help of their tauren brethren. Naming their new land Durotar after Thrall's murdered father, the orcs settled down to rebuild their once-glorious society.

[page 2106]
next_page=2107
text=Now that the demon curse was ended, the Horde changed from a warlike juggernaut into more of a loose coalition, dedicated to survival and prosperity rather than conquest. Aided by the noble tauren and the cunning trolls of the Darkspear tribe, Thrall and his orcs looked forward to a new era of peace in their own land.

[page 2107]
next_page=2108
text=The remaining Alliance forces under Jaina Proudmoore settled in southern Kalimdor. Off the eastern coast of Dustwallow Marsh, they built the rugged port city of Theramore. There, the humans and their dwarven allies worked to survive in a land that would always be hostile to them. Though the defenders of Durotar and Theramore kept the tentative truce with one another, the fragile colonial serenity was not meant to last.

[page 2108]
next_page=2109
text=The peace between the orcs and humans was shattered by the arrival of a massive Alliance fleet in Kalimdor. The mighty fleet, under the command of Grand Admiral Daelin Proudmoore (Jaina's father), had left Lordaeron before Arthas had destroyed the kingdom. Having sailed for many grueling months, Admiral Proudmoore was searching for any Alliance survivors he could find.

[page 2109]
next_page=2110
text=Proudmoore's armada posed a serious threat to the stability of the region. As a renowned hero of the Second War, Jaina's father was a staunch enemy of the Horde, and he was determined to destroy Durotar before the orcs could gain a foothold in the land.

[page 2110]
next_page=2111
text=The Grand Admiral forced Jaina to make a terrible decision: support him in battle against the orcs and betray her newfound allies, or fight her own father to maintain the fragile peace that the Alliance and the Horde had finally attained. After much soul-searching, Jaina chose the latter and helped Thrall defeat her crazed father.

[page 2111]
text=Unfortunately Admiral Proudmoore died in battle before Jaina could reconcile with him or prove that orcs were no longer bloodthirsty monsters. For her loyalty, the orcs allowed Jaina's forces to return home safely to Theramore.

text=About 16,000 years ago (long before the night elves foolishly called down the wrath of the Burning Legion), trolls lorded over much of Kalimdor (then a single continent). There were twin troll empires -- the Gurubashi Empire of the southeastern jungles -- and the Amani Empire of the middle forestlands.

[page 2192]
next_page=2193
text=There were smaller tribes that lived far to the north (in the region now known as Northrend). These tribes founded a small nation known as Gundrak, but never achieved the size or prosperity of the southern empires.

[page 2193]
next_page=2194
text=The Gurubashi and Amani empires had little love for one another, but rarely warred against each other. At the time, their greatest common enemy was a third empire -- the civilization of Azj'Aqir. The aqir were intelligent insectoids who ruled the lands of the far west. These clever insectoids were greatly expansionistic and incredibly evil. The aqir were obsessed with eradicating all non-insect life from the fields of Kalimdor.

[page 2194]
next_page=2195
text=The trolls fought them for many thousands of years, but never succeeded in winning a true victory over the aqir. Eventually, due to the troll's persistence, the aqiri kingdom split in half as its citizens fled to separate colonies in the far northern and southern regions of the continent.

[page 2195]
next_page=2196
text=Two aqiri city-states emerged -- Azjol-Nerub in the northern wastes, and Ahn'Qiraj in the southern desert. Though the trolls suspected that there were other aqiri colonies beneath Kalimdor, their existence was never verified.

[page 2196]
next_page=2197
text=With the insectoids driven into exile, the twin troll empires returned to business as usual. Despite their great victory, neither civilization expanded much farther than their original boundaries. However, ancient texts speak of a small faction of trolls that broke off from the Amani Empire and founded their own colony in the heart of the dark continent.

[page 2197]
text=There, these brave pioneers discovered the cosmic Well of Eternity which transformed them into beings of immense power. Some legends suggest that these adventurous trolls were the first night elves, though this theory has never been proven.

[page 2198]
next_page=2199
text=Aside from their shadowy origins, it is clear that the night elves came to power soon after their discovery of the Well of Eternity. Despite the trolls' attempts to keep them from expanding their territories, the night elves built up a mighty empire that expanded rapidly across primordial Kalimdor. Wielding fierce magics never before imagined by the superstitious trolls, the night elves had little trouble doing what the evil aqir could never do: topple the two greatest empires in the world.

[page 2199]
next_page=2200
text=The night elves systematically dismantled the troll's defenses and supply chains. The trolls, unable to counter the elves' destructive magics, buckled under the onslaught. The night elves proved to every bit as cunning and bloodthirsty as the savage trolls -- incurring the latter race's eternal hatred and disdain. The Gurubashi and Amani empires fragmented within only a few short years.

[page 2200]
next_page=2201
text=Eventually, the night elves were burned by the arcane fires they had sought to control. Their reckless use of magic had lured the demonic Burning Legion to the world. The demons crushed much of the night elves' civilization. Though there are no records to indicate that the Legion attacked either troll civilization, it is likely that battles took place across the breadth of the continent.

[page 2201]
next_page=2202
text=At the end of this terrible conflict -- known as the War of the Ancients -- the Well of Eternity imploded. The resulting shockwave shattered the greater landmass of Kalimdor. The center of the continent was blasted beneath the sea, leaving only a small group of broken, single continents.

[page 2202]
text=Thus, great chunks of both the Amani and Gurubashi Empires still exist in the present day lands of Quel'Thalas and Stranglethorn (respectively). The Azj'Aqir kingdoms of Azjol-Nerub and Ahn'Qiraj have also survived in present day Northrend and Tanaris (respectively).
text=
text=Both troll civilizations recoiled from the vast destruction of the primordial world they had known. The dauntless trolls rebuilt their ravaged cities and set about to reclaim some of their former power.

[page 2203]
next_page=2204
text=The long centuries following the Great Sundering of the world were difficult ones for the troll race. Famine and terror were commonplace within the broken kingdoms. The Gurubashi trolls, driven to desperate ends, sought aid from ancient, mystical forces. Though both of the troll kingdoms shared a central belief in a great pantheon of primitive gods, the Gurubashi fell under the sway of the darkest one.

[page 2204]
next_page=2205
text=Hakkar the Soulflayer, a vile, bloodthirsty spirit, heard the trolls' call and decided to aid them. Hakkar gave his secrets of blood to the Gurubashi and helped them extend their civilization across most of Stranglethorn Vale and certain islands of the South Seas. Though he brought them great power, Hakkar wanted more and more for his efforts.

[page 2205]
next_page=2206
text=The bloodthirsty god demanded souls be sacrificed to him daily. He dreamed of gaining access to the physical world so he could devour the blood of all mortal creatures. In time the Gurubashi realized what kind of creature they had courted with -- and turned against him. The strongest tribes rose up against Hakkar and his loyal priests -- the Atal'ai.

[page 2206]
next_page=2207
text=The terrible war that ensued between Hakkar's followers and the rest of the Gurubashi tribes is spoken of only in whispers. The budding empire was shattered by the magic unleashed between the angry god and his rebel children. Just as the battle seemed most hopeless, the trolls succeeded in destroying Hakkar's avatar and banishing him from the world.

[page 2207]
next_page=2208
text=Even his Atal'ai priests were eventually driven from the capital of Zul'Gurub and forced to survive in the uncharted swamplands to the north. Within those shadowy fens they built a great temple to their fallen god -- Atal'Hakkar -- where they could continue to do their master's work...

[page 2208]
text=The rest of the Gurubashi tribes went their separate ways after the great civil war had left their lands in ruins. The Skullsplitter, Bloodscalp and Darkspear tribes set off to claim their own lands withtin the vast jungles of Stranglethorn. Though a fragile peace had settled over the broken empire, some spoke of a prophecy that Hakkar would one day be reborn into the world -- and on that day -- he would consume it whole.

text=Too often people like the followers of the Holy Light scare those curious about true power into thinking they cannot investigate any form of the arcane--not all things from outside this world are evil.

text=The Feast of Winter Veil$B$BThe later seasons of Azeroth are marked as a time of change in many cultures.  The dwarves and the tauren especially look to a legend of the coming Winter Veil - the blanketing of the land in snow, thus heralding a time of renewal - as a time for celebration.  Though the understanding of the legends that the races of Azeroth share are not dissimilar, the ways they choose to acknowledge them are as diverse as the races themselves.

[page 2572]
next_page=2573
text=The Legend of Greatfather Winter$B$BThe term "Winter Veil" is said to stem from a supernatural being referred in many cultures to as Greatfather Winter.  As he would walk the land late in the seasons, winter itself would be his billowing cloak.  In his wake was the blanketing of the land in snow, and thus it is said that Greatfather Winter would cast his wintry veil over the land.  Though parts of Azeroth may lie in snow, it gives the land time for rebirth and renewal.

[page 2573]
next_page=2574
text=The Dwarves$B$BEver consumed with the research of their origins, the dwarves choose to celebrate the season as a recognition of Greatfather Winter himself.  They consider him to be the personification of one of the ancients of Azeroth - the titans.  Much as they claim lineage in one degree or another to these mystical beings, they consider their snowy home of Dun Morogh as the prime example of Greatfather Winter's blessings.

[page 2574]
next_page=2575
text=The Tauren$B$BThe tauren and their shamanistic understanding of winter, along with their recent emergence into druidic endeavors, fit in well with the legend of Winter Veil.  They focus almost entirely on the renewing aspects of the lore however, leaving legend worship to those races (as they view it) less in tune with nature of things.  Many tauren choose this time as the right time to give thanks for the blessings of their new home in Mulgore.

[page 2575]
next_page=2576
text=Feasting$B$BThe idea of feasting during this time of year is one that traces its origins to the legend itself.  As Greatfather Winter walked Azeroth, bringing winter in his wake, it is said he would provide a bounty for those who welcomed his presence.  As such, the idea of feasting during the Winter Veil would bring together communities as they shared whatever they had.  Typically, a single day of merriment and feasting welcomed the change, all in anticipation of the land's renewal.

[page 2576]
text=Modern Day Observation$B$BOther cultures have begun to recognize the Feast of Winter Veil as a time of great celebration, though not in the same traditions as the legend bases it in.  Customs, often unrelated to anything other than a chance for celebration and gift exchange, have made their way into modern day observation of the season.  Even the image of Greatfather Winter is sometimes used, but more as a harbinger of commercial exploit rather than as a supernatural titan.

text=Set far back in the Valley of Spears is the holy temple of Maraudon. If that were not transgression enough, you will quickly see why I have asked a non-centaur to aid me in my plight.$B$BThere, just beyond the doors where only spirits and our most sacred priests and priestesses may travel is one called The Nameless Prophet. He is the highest of any tribe in spiritual matters and is one of the oldest of any tribe.

[page 2592]
next_page=2593
text=The Prophet is powerful, and communicates with the spirits of our ancestors. But he is a fool! He has no idea the true power he possesses. On his person is the Amulet of Spirits--it is where most of his strength comes from.
text=
text=I have learned that the Amulet is powerful, but it is incomplete.

[page 2593]
next_page=2595
text=There are five gems missing from the amulet. And if those gems were found and placed back into the symbol, its power would far exceed that of its current form. I have found the five gems, but need one of your skill to help gather them. Slaying The Nameless Prophet is heresy for sure, as is stealing from his corpse, but what I would ask of you next would condemn any centaur for even thinking it.

text=Throughout the caverns of Maraudon roam the spirits of our first Kahns. Our Mother and Father's first children, and our greatest leaders--they are Gelk, Kolk, Magra, Maraudos, and Veng. Each of these spirits holds one of the missing gems.
text=

[page 2596]
text=Use the power of the Amulet of Spirits to force them to manifest and take the gems from them! After, place the gems within the Amulet of Spirits and return it to me. Once I have the Amulet of Union, I will be powerful enough to reform the tribes so we can finally be as our ancestors wanted us to be!

text=Peeling the Onion
text=The How to Guide On Dismantling the Stormpike
text=-By Drek'Thar
text=
text=Within these pages you will find a wealth of knowledge on battle tactics and politics. The learned soldier is the soldier that leans on the shoulder of experience. Let this book serve as a guide in your battle for Alterac Valley.
text=

[page 2772]
next_page=2773
text=Chapter 1 - The Front Line
text=
text=Dismantling the Stormpike army is very much like peeling an onion. To get to the core, you must start by removing the outermost layers.
text=
text=The front lines, comprised mostly of Stormpike Mountaineers and Alliance Sentinels, are tied to the Captain's bunker. It is Captain Balinda Stonehearth who empowers these units and provides for reinforcements when the lines are under siege. Strike at the Captain and the front line forces will crumble.
text=
text=

[page 2773]
next_page=2774
text=Chapter 2 - The Twin Towers
text=
text=Make no mistake; Vanndar Stormpike is a cunning foe and certainly no fool. Once the front line has been breached, the secondary defensive targets must still be destroyed. It is the twin towers of Stonehearth and Icewing which control the Stormpike Guardians outside of Dun Baldar and the Stormpike patrols.

[page 2774]
next_page=2775
text=Beware, soldier, as both of these towers are heavily fortified and ruled over by one of Vanndar's elite Commanders. Should your forces breach the fortifications, make certain that the Commander within has been ... silenced. This too will be part of the dismantling of the Stormpike.
text=

[page 2775]
next_page=2776
text=Chapter 3 - The Four Commanders
text=
text=The third layer of the Strompike onion is comprised of the four Commanders. In this respect, Vanndar has mimicked our own glorious Frostwolf defenses. Of course he will tell you otherwise... But I digress.
text=
text=The four Commanders control the ebb and flow of the Stormpike Guardians that fiercely guard Dun Baldar. Silence them all and the Stormpike Guardians will fall.
text=
text=Then there is but one layer left to peel.
text=

[page 2776]
next_page=2777
text=Chapter 4 - The Dun Baldar Bunkers
text=
text=As you have undoubtedly noticed, the Stormpike defensive layers are in place to prevent one mighty power move from dismantling the entire army. Before you ask, yes, this is exactly how our own forces are setup and no, I will not change our defensive structure. They copied us, why should we have to change?
text=

[page 2777]
next_page=2778
text=Where was I? Yes, so, the Dun Baldar bunkers (which are located in Dun Baldar) control the Stormpike Defenders - Vanndar's most trusted and elite guard units. Destroy those two towers and the reinforcements sent to aid Vanndar will cease to exist.

[page 2778]
text=Epilogue
text=
text=After having done all of this, you are left with the center of the onion: The sweet core. Vanndar Stormpike will be left defenseless and alone. Rules of military conduct require that we ask for his surrender before carrying out any executions. Be sure to mention the surrender thing when you see him... then kill him.

[page 2779]

text=The Frostwolf Artichoke: Tales of Stormpike Glory
text=-By Vanndar Stormpike
text=
text=What is Frostwolf? The answer is simple: The Frostwolf are savages trying to halt our sovereign imperialistic imperative.
text=
text=Much like an artichoke, the Frostwolf have a prickly, shielded set of defenses and much like an artichoke, once the outer layer is peeled away, the heart is exposed, ready to be eaten with a fine garlic dip.
text=
text=Delicious!
text=

[page 2780]
next_page=2781
text=Chapter 1 - The Front Line
text=
text=The front lines of the Frostwolf's defenses are comprised of Frostwolf Warriors. The warriors are deployed to the front lines from Captain Galvangar's fortress: Iceblood Garrison. The most efficient manner in which to take out this layer of the defenses is to take out Iceblood Garrison.
text=
text=Lay siege to the fortress and destroy Captain Galvangar. Once this is done, the front lines will crumble.
text=

[page 2781]
next_page=2782
text=Chapter 2 - Iceblood and Tower Point
text=
text=Once the first layer is down, the second layer of the 'artichoke' will be exposed. Destroying the Frostwolf towers that sit near the front lines will cripple the Legionnaire and patrols that swarm the rear flank.
text=
text=The towers are heavily fortified, each housing one of Drek'Thar's elite Commanders. They must be killed. This will expedite the dismantling of the Frostwolf defenses.

[page 2782]
next_page=2783
text=Chapter 3 - The Four Commanders
text=
text=If you have been following the wisdom of this guide, then by now, two of Drek'Thar's Commanders are dead. Good work, soldier! Their resolve is already weakening. You must now complete the dissemination of the chain of command by slaying the remaining two commanders.
text=
text=With all four of the Commander slain, the Frostwolf Legionnaires that guard Frostwolf Keep will be scattered - left without command. Ripe for the picking!
text=

[page 2783]
next_page=2784
text=Chapter 4 - The East and West Frostwolf Towers
text=
text=There is now only one layer standing between you and victory; Drek'Thar's most trusted and powerful guard units: The Frostwolf Guardians.
text=
text=The Frostwolf Guardians are sent out from the platoons held in reserve at the east and west Frostwolf towers. Destroy those towers and watch the remaining Frostwolf Guardians flee in shame.

[page 2784]
text=Epilogue
text=
text="Smother the heart of the artichoke with garlic butter and mayonnaise. Compliment the meal with an aged, heady ale."
text=
text=Drek'Thar now stands alone, his two mutts at his side. Capture the Frostwolf Relief Hut to aid in your battle and destroy Drek'Thar. When the General falls, this land will finally turn over to its rightful owner: The Stormpike.
