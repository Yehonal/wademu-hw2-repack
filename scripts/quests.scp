details=Greetings $C, I am Gabriel, Archangel of the Order of Light.$B$BI see you came here to help me. I am an Agent from the Order of Light and came with an important mission to this mountain. We have to stop the Leaders of the different areas because they prevent that the World Tree can regenerate. So your first task is the cleaning of the trolls. Their master,the Angel of Apocalypse, who was one of ours before, corrupts them with his dark aura. He pressures them to make mysterious mixtures out of the trees leaves. To stop his corruption you have to kill him and bring me his Dark Essence. Before you come to the corrupted terrain head to the right. But you can not kill him alone, bring your allies and together we will fight for a better world.

You see only mountains behind me? Then you're wrong. There is abandoned defence tower left after battle of Mount Hyjal. As not that much time passed since war ended, tower should work without any problems. The only thing we need is to get to that tower. It may look easy but our scouts have searched for months and haven't found mountain pass. One of our men says that he heard leaders of war ordering sorcerers to make portal to tower and hide it from enemy. So as we couldn't find any way by foot, maybe there is other way, a magical way.

First is the gazebo and the second is killing. The loc of Mystal Lake is 47,70. That loc is the island in which the gazebo sits on. On that island are 6 water elementals. Merciless bastards.

Near the stroke of midnight, the man ran down the stairs screaming, his face pale with fear. Still wearing his bedclothes, he disappeared into the downpour.$B$BIn his haste he forgot his letters in the chest upstairs. He never returned for them. One remains from that Stalvan fellow, intended for the Canal District in Stormwind. Help yourself to it.

He sends his soldiers to do his bidding but stays elusive, avoiding danger.$B$BIf you can find the spineless scum, slay him and bring me his ear.  I will reward you, $C.

You have served your Queen well.$b$b<Bethor opens the book and stares intently at its glowing pages...>$b$bAstonishing! The book you retrieved belongs to no one other than Gunther Arcanus!$b$bGunther was a skilled Necromancer in life; he and I were friends and comrades-in-arms, before the Plague. And judging from his book he has grown even more powerful in death.$b$bHis skills would be a great boon to us.
details=There is a lich who dwells on the island in Brightwater Lake to the north.  Although he is a free-willed Forsaken, he believes all other Undead are Scourge slaves and has his minions attack anyone who approaches him.$B$BBut because he is Forsaken, the Queen will want him.  And if he is skilled in Necromancy, then his knowledge would be...quite useful to us.$B$BTo discover his identity and his talents, I must see his spellbook.

A dark time for all.
details=First, let me tell you more of the task you must complete. The druids in Darnassus use the water of the moonwells of Teldrassil, and their moonwell must be replenished from time to time. Using these specially crafted phials, you can collect the water of the moonwells.$B$BTake this vessel to the moonwell outside of Starbreeze Village to the east, and fill it with some of its waters, then return to me.

But Nozdormu, Lord of Time, refused to give his blessing, chiding the $C for his arrogance. In agreement with Nozdormu, Alexstrasza also refused Staghelm, and without her blessing, Teldrassil's growth has been flawed and unpredictable...
details=All was not well with Teldrassil, however. Staghelm's carefully made plans for the new World Tree had borne out as he had hoped, but there was one small problem, a problem to which many of the troubles on Teldrassil may be attributed.$B$BHowever, I will not get into that yet.

Truly it says much of my current companions--with no offense to my hosts, the noble grells and satyrs--that your presence could be considered an improvement.$B$BBut please, do not let my uncivil tongue drive you from the place. It has indeed been many years, decades even, since I had civil accompaniment.
details=The ruins of Bashal'Aran to the east are overrun with demonic minions. The sprites and satyrs that have taken up residence in the area feed upon the magical energies of the area, their powers growing from continued exposure.$B$BEven with that, I have noticed that there is one shrine they will not approach. On the western side of the ruins, atop a small bluff, a strange blue aura permeates... There must be an explanation to the demons' reluctance.$B$BI would like you to investigate it.

details=The key to Scholomance is called a Skeleton Key. It must be forged from the remains of a skeleton - several actually - and hardened by only the strongest of metals within a suitable mold. A signet of power from a being who naturally can open the portal to Scholomance will make the key ultimately function.$B$BFirst thing's first though, $N.

desc=Search through Velinde's chest for her journal, then return it along with the key to Thyn'tel Bladeweaver in Darnassus.
details=The Tome of Mel'Thandris showed you this? I suppose there would be little harm in allowing you to examine her belongings. This key will allow you to open the chest where we stored her things in the Sentinels' bunkhouse. She kept a journal of her duties, if there is anything to be learned, it will be from that.$B$BI should tell you, the Sentinels believe that she had her own reasons for leaving, and expect that she could return at any time. The priestess has done much in the past to earn our trust.$B$BAdditional Notes:$B$BTo give a slightly more detailed description of where the chest is: Find the mail armor shop in the Tradesmans' Terrance east of the Temple of the Moon. Go upstairs, then across the bridge, and you should find it.

completion=Eliminate Gerenzo? Now there is a prospect that I have no objections to.$b$bGnomes are bad enough as it is, but what I learned about Gerenzo only makes it worse. Apparently, he was one of the head engineers in Gnomeregan, where he was working on their secret project--we could never infiltrate Dun Morogh well enough to find out specific details. It was a failure. Our reports say that whatever it was literally exploded in their faces.
details=The matter of this gnome that has been hired by the Venture Company has caused a bit of a stir in Undermine. The trade princes do not approve of Razdunk's consorting with this Gerenzo.$B$B Riddlevox has asked me to take care of the problem, and I'm sure he was instructed to do so by one or more of the trade princes. Of course, the Director didn't tell me that. Let's just say I have a hunch.$B$B Whatever the case, Gerenzo must be removed, and it would be a fitting test to have Fizziks take care of him.

She also has a beard and she smells kinda funny, but that don't do nothing to stop her fishing. I reckon you have what it takes to use a Blump Family Fishing Pole.
details=I love fishing.  The Blump family is known for fishing.  My name is Gubber Blump; I fish.$B$BThere's a kind of fish I like to catch around these parts called Darkshore grouper. I used to go out on a boat to fish for grouper, but no boats have been going out since them mean ol' murlocs moved in. I bet they been eating up all the grouper too.$B$BSay, you wanna help me catch Darkshore grouper? I'd give you a bona fide Blump Family Fishing Pole if you did! It's a real good pole to catch fish with.

The time has come for you to learn about destruction... and chaos. The element of fire is yours for the understanding, if you're prepared to pay for it. Seek out Kranal Fiss in the Barrens. He lives in a small dwelling north of the Crossroads, but be mindful, if you've reached the night elf lands, you've gone too far.

completion=Ah, my mistake, $N. I apologize. I did not realize you possessed the Torch. I am pleased to make your acquaintance.$B$BMany adventurers find their way here while looking for lost treasure or the promise of mystical creatures to slay, only to be turned away from a seemingly empty shrine. But we know the truth, do we not, $N?$B$BThis shrine holds a greater secret from the mundane members of the Horde. To us, it is sacred.
details=You are powerful enough to wield the totem of fire, but that does not mean you are ready.$B$BAlong the Southfury River in Durotar, before the Great Sea, lies a hidden trail to one of the highest peaks in the land. Find your way to the top and you shall find one of our holy shrines watched over by Telf Joolam--the Shrine of the Dormant Flame.$B$BTake this torch to him--it marks that you attempt to tame fire. Return it to me aflame by the brazier at the shrine and I will see you are given the totem of fire.

Only those knowledgeable enough in the shamanistic arts will ever learn the secrets of this place and the power it holds.

completion=These will do nicely, $N.$B$BFire is more than chaos and destruction--do well to remember that. It is also about life, and creation. All things are tied together in such a way. Forces oppose one another, but at the same time, one cannot exist without the other. Both extinguish one another, but also give one another meaning. Always remember this.$B$BUsing different types of magic in conjunction with one another will show not only true skill, but great wisdom.
details=But you did not come here for a history lesson, did you? You came for the Eternal Flame and fire totem.$B$BThe first step is to create a sapta and bind you to the flame.$B$BI can create the fire sapta for you if you bring me two items. The first is fire tar, a simple item usually carried by Razormane spellcasters in eastern Barrens.$B$BThe second item will be more dangerous: a reagent pouch from one of the cultists of the Burning Blade. You can find them in a cave above the ravines northeast of Razor Hill.
incomplete=I have enough ingredients for a sapta of fire if you can find the reagent pouch and some fire tar. The Burning Blade fanatics carry the proper components for most of their spells in those pouches, and usually have enough of the items I need that we will not have to search much farther for anything else.$B$BThe saptas are always made from ingredients that are closely tied to their respective elements. It makes our work easier because of the warlocks' ties to fire.

details=$N, your skill as a leatherworker precedes you. I possess leatherworking lore you would be wise to acquire... Wild Leather armor! Wild Leather taps into the potent and chaotic properties of wildvines, found in areas of lush vegetation and on some of the creatures there. Armor made using it is second to none for a crafter of your skill, guaranteed.$B$BI'll teach you, but you'll be working for me for a while. The first cost is simply ten pieces of thick leather.

incomplete=We must be clear; you shall be apprenticed to me while you learn the art of Wild Leather armor.

details=The venom from the broodguards wasn't as potent as the venom you brought originally.  It must have come from a different spider.$B$BI want a fresh sample of that venom.  To find out where it came from, you must consult with a troll who knows the Witherbark well--Master Gadrin in Sen'jin Village.  Travel to Durotar and speak with Gadrin.

Look at what "normal" magic did to our home. Coupled with those damned tinkerers, our race almost became extinct. And now we have to rely on the dwarves-- they'd rather spend time allying with humans than help us rebuild our own home. We're like second-class citizens. Have you seen the way they look at us?

details=Expert engineering yields two distinct disciplines: gnome and goblin.  I only bother to mention goblin engineering because I'm a fair trainer.  They like to make things that blow up, and they rarely care what is in the way - even themselves.$B$B$N, read this manual.  If you want to learn how to blow yourself up, then take it to Nixx Sprocketspring in Gadgetzan.   Remember - membership is permanent and prevents joining the other discipline, so make sure this is what you want before finishing his task.

details=During my stay here, I have heard strange rumors about mysterious pylons existing out in the wilderness of the crater, $N. I guess that they are quite large, with crystals lining their interiors.$B$B Although I've never seen one, I can't help but think that the rumors are true -- and that the pylons have something to do with all the crystals we found$B$B So why don't you help me put my curiosity to rest? Supposedly, there is one in the eastern area of the crater. Do you think you can find it?

I can't help but hope that if you can find a solution by searching for one of the pylons that I have heard exist.$B$B Perhaps if we combine certain colors at them... but I get ahead of myself.

The challenge was small compared to Lar'korwi, but I will not take such a great victory away from you.$b$bThese pelts will make wonderful clothing for my tribe.

Odd.$b$bRegardless, I will hold onto this until you are ready for your confrontation with the beast. Do not worry for my safety--I am sure you've angered Lar'korwi enough that he will not kill me until after he's tasted your flesh.
details=Once, a long time ago, a brother of mine took some meat from one of Lar'korwi's kills. He didn't know it at the time, but Lar'korwi saw him from the forest. Lar'korwi followed my brother for days, destroying everything he touched. My brother, scared, finally decided to run from the Crater and leave Lar'korwi behind.$B$B Lar'korwi killed him not far from this spot.$B$B If you want to provoke Lar'korwi, find a fresh kill of his and take some of the meat from it.$B$B Return to me afterwards.

completion=Ah, fine specimens, $N. The two pieces you've found should be perfect for baiting Lar'korwi into the open. I cannot wait to see the outcome of your fight with the monster. He is a massive thing with claws as sharp as the finest blades. You will look into his eyes and you will know death.
details=I'm actually surprised he has not come for you yet, $N. But all is well, for I have a final plan that will bring the monster to us.$B$B Being the dominant male gives Lar'korwi rights to breed with any female he chooses--and he chooses many of them. You'll find many ravasaur eggs to the west of here. Get close to them and you should provoke an attack by his mates. The females produce an awful smell from a gland in their heads that allow males to know they are ready to breed. Bring me one of those glands.
incomplete=Be careful, $N. Getting close to any of nest of eggs surely will provoke the mothers... even if you've already secured a gland from one. The mothers can be just as deadly as Lar'korwi himself when they fight to protect their young. But, if you are successful, then we shall have a definitive way of bringing Lar'korwi out from hiding.

And your strength has been fortified. I bow down to your skills.$b$bOnly the greatest of my ancestors could have accomplished something so incredible. Congratulations.
details=This will be the most difficult part because there is some complexity to the plan. To the north of here, you will find a small trail into the mountains. It was here I saw Lar'korwi last. You will know you are in the right area because of all the bones from massive creatures that once wandered nearby. Take the meat you recovered and place it there. Then, rub the gland on the meat. If both lures mingled together do not bring Lar'korwi to you, then I know nothing else that will.

Perhaps it is also one step closer to figuring out what the silithid are all about.

I feel more comfortable asking you to not only face down a malfeasant demon, but also to bring back a dangerous item in the process...

Who would suspect someone so young and so brave would rise up and champion our cause? You remind me of myself when I was younger. I will ensure that you are justly rewarded for your efforts if we both survive the coming storm.$b$bBut there is time for more praise later. You've not accomplished anything in comparison to what you will face... but this is a good start.

completion=I am glad you've returned, $N. Some of those loyal to me brought word immediately that the caverns below Orgrimmar were in disarray now that their leaders have been slain. I even heard reports that Neeru was more than agitated. It seems we've put a dent in his armor. I can't say I'm displeased... even with such a minor victory.
details=Hmm, leaders of the Searing Blade... this concerns me most. If they are the ones of value to Neeru, then those are who we must target first. This satyr... Bazzalan, and the other Neeru mentioned--what was he, a warlock?--must be slain.$B$BReturn to the Cleft of Shadow and enter Ragefire Chasm, $N. Find these two leaders of the Searing Blade, and kill them. But be careful not to let Neeru know it was you who did this. You must retain your identity as one of his $gbrothers:sisters; in arms.

In sending travelers into Ragefire Chasm, I should have seen the possibility that some harm would come from it. It seems both Bazzalan and Jergosh were taken unaware and slain by some of Thrall's do-gooders. A most inopportune time, but there is nothing that can be done about it now.
details=I think our next step should be to have you placed close to Neeru. If he is as agitated as reports suggest, then we may accomplish two things. One, you may be able to gain some greater knowledge about the Council or at least the Burning Blade, and two, he may just begin to trust you enough that he asks you to start to aid him. He may very well look at you as someone who can fill the void now that some of the leadership is in turmoil.$B$BReturn to the Cleft and speak to him again, but do not be too overt.

It's not my job to question what that importance is, but regardless, I'm in no shape to continue until I rest up.$B$BIf you're willing, I'd pay handsomely for some help.

I want you to deliver it to Zilzibin Drumlore in the Drag of Orgrimmar. He's an expert on alien creatures like these; I hope he can do something with the lore we've obtained.

details=Shortly after the fall of the Gurubashi, we Zandalar almost succumbed to a final defeat from evil within our own tribe.  It was then that the confessors amongst us arose, preserving the tribe by banishing out those who would destroy their own kind.  They not only keep us in tune with the spirits, but they also preserve the flesh.$B$BGo forth into Zul'Gurub and witness first hand the depravity of Hakkar and the Gurubashi.  Wrest the Paragons of Power that we seek from them; success will be rewarded!

The bad news is that there are more kinds of poisonous creatures crawling around the southern area so you'll have to draw from more sources.

They are apparently a means for the Qiraji and other unknown entities to communicate various messages to the silithid.$B$BUnfortunately, that is all we could get out of the glyphs. We need to find a way to unlock the messages hidden within the crystals.$B$BTake the glyphed crystal prism to Geologist Larksbane at Cenarion Hold.  She might be able to help.

Should the Qiraji Emissary appear, slay it and recover the Crystal Unlocking Mechanism. Return to Geologist Larksbane if you succeed.$B$BAssemble an army for this task, $N!
details=The glyphs illustrate an emissary of the Qiraji meeting with three silithid at the bones of a large dragon. Above the glyphs is what I can only assume to be a code of some sort. This code might very well be the key to summoning the emissary.$B$BI will create a copy of the glyph code that you must use in the sand at the Bones of Grakkarond. If I am right, the Overlords will come thinking that new data is ready for transmission. Strike them down and confront the emissary. He holds the key to the crystals...
